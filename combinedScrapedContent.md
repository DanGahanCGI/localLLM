Dear Mr O’Sullivan
Special Conditions

You will be aware that Ofqual has been in discussion with representatives of the
University in relation to the governance arrangements of Cambridge Assessment
International Education and Cambridge Assessment English and Ofqual’s regulatory
requirements.

David Parson's email of 26 January 2018 to Ofqual confirmed approval of the
proposed Special Conditions sent to it by Ofqual on 14 December 2017 (with minor
technical amendments to reflect the formal title of the University).

We are therefore sending alongside this letter, Special Conditions CU1 and CU2,
which have now been imposed and which have immediate effect.

You will see that the definition of ‘Governing Body’ in Condition J1.8 of Ofqual’s
General Conditions of Recognition, in respect of the University which is the entity we
regulate and which is accountable to Ofqual for Cambridge Assessment International
Education and Cambridge Assessment English, is replaced with the Press and
Assessment Board.

In the interests of transparency, please note that Ofqual intends to publish these
Special Conditions on our website.

If you have any queries relating to this letter please let us know as soon as possible.
Yours sincerely,

Sonia Sharma
Senior Lawyer

#  Section A - Governance

Rules about governance of awarding organisations, including management of
conflicts of interest, risks, incidents and malpractice

## Condition A1 - Suitability for continuing recognition

### Suitability for continuing recognition

  1. A1.1 An awarding organisation must not, by means of any act or omission which has or is likely to have an Adverse Effect, render itself unsuitable to continue to be recognised for the award of a relevant qualification.

  1. A1.2 For the purposes of Condition A1.1, an act or omission may include in particular one which results in the awarding organisation – 
    1. (a) being convicted of a criminal offence,
    2. (b) being held by a court or any professional, regulatory, or government body to have breached any provision of Competition Law, Equalities Law, or Data Protection Law,
    3. (c) being held by a court or any professional, regulatory, or government body to have breached a provision of any other legislation or any regulatory obligation to which it is subject, or
    4. (d) becoming insolvent or subject to corporate financial restructuring.

### Inactive awarding organisations

  1. A1.3 An awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) ensure that, within two years of first being recognised for the award of qualifications, it has submitted to Ofqual for accreditation or directly to the Register a qualification that meets its Conditions of Recognition, and
    2. (b) take all reasonable steps to ensure that, once it has complied with Condition A1.3(a), it awards a qualification in a way that complies with its Conditions of Recognition at least once in every two-year period.

### Ensuring the suitability of Senior Officers

  1. A1.4 An awarding organisation must ensure that each of its Senior Officers is at all times a person suitable to be engaged in that role in an awarding organisation that is recognised for the award of the relevant qualifications.

  1. A1.5 For the purposes of Condition A1.4, a Senior Officer may in particular be unsuitable for that role by virtue of – 
    1. (a) any criminal convictions held by him or her,
    2. (b) any finding by a court or any professional, regulatory, or government body that he or she has breached a provision of any legislation or any regulatory obligation to which he or she is subject,
    3. (c) any proceedings in bankruptcy or any individual financial arrangement to which he or she is or has been subject,
    4. (d) any disqualification from holding the directorship of a company or from public office, or
    5. (e) any finding of malpractice or maladministration, in relation to a qualification (whether a regulated qualification or a qualification which is not regulated), to which he or she is or has been subject.

### Guidance on Condition A1

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * is clear about which acts or omissions will have, or are likely to have, an Adverse Effect, and is aware of the type of actions and behaviours that could cause it to happen;
  * makes sure all relevant staff understand which acts or omissions will have, or are likely to have, an Adverse Effect;
  * has considered the behaviours that might be unsuitable for its Senior Officers, taking into account the market in which it operates and the qualifications it provides;
  * uses appropriate information and evidence to make a judgement when it checks the suitability of its Senior Officers, both at the time of appointment and at regular intervals when in post – for example as a result of up-to-date voluntary disclosure or other appropriate checks.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * appoints a Senior Officer without knowing, or despite knowing, they were unsuitable for the post;
  * does not ensure that its Senior Officers understand, at the time of appointment and once in post, what is expected of them in order to be suitable;
  * does not identify or address its Senior Officers’ behaviours that make them unsuitable for the role;
  * does not act promptly and appropriately when a Senior Officer becomes unsuitable for the role.

## Condition A2 - Establishment in the UK, Gibraltar, the EU or the EFTA

  1. A2.1 An awarding organisation must ensure that it at all times – 
    1. (a) is ordinarily resident in the UK, Gibraltar or a member state of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association, or
    2. (b) has a substantial presence in the UK, Gibraltar or a member state of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association.

There is currently no guidance on complying with this Condition

## Condition A3 - Safeguards on Change of Control

### Duty on Change of Control

  1. A3.1 Where there is a Change of Control in relation to an awarding organisation, it must – 
    1. (a) take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Change of Control does not have an Adverse Effect,
    2. (b) Procure that every other relevant person takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the Change of Control does not have an Adverse Effect, and
    3. (c) put in place a plan designed to ensure that the interests of Learners will be protected.

There is currently no guidance on complying with these Conditions

## Condition A4 - Conflicts of Interest

### Identifying Conflicts of Interest

  1. A4.1 An awarding organisation must identify and monitor – 
    1. (a) all Conflicts of Interest which relate to it, and
    2. (b) any scenario in which it is reasonably foreseeable that any such Conflict of Interest will arise in the future.

  1. A4.2 An awarding organisation must establish and maintain an up to date record of all Conflicts of Interest which relate to it.

### Managing Conflicts of Interest

  1. A4.3 An awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure that no Conflict of Interest which relates to it has an Adverse Effect.

  1. A4.4 Where such a Conflict of Interest has had an Adverse Effect, the awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the Adverse Effect as far as possible and correct it.

### Interests in assessment

  1. A4.5 An awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to avoid any part of the assessment of a Learner (including by way of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny) being undertaken by any person who has a personal interest in the result of the assessment.

  1. A4.6 Where, having taken all such reasonable steps, an assessment by such a person cannot be avoided, the awarding organisation must make arrangements for the relevant part of the assessment to be subject to scrutiny by another person.

### The written conflict of interest policy

  1. A4.7 An awarding organisation must establish, maintain, and at all times comply with an up to date written conflict of interest policy, which must include procedures on how the awarding organisation intends to comply with the requirements of this condition.

  1. A4.8 When requested to do so by Ofqual in writing, an awarding organisation must promptly submit to Ofqual its conflict of interest policy, and must subsequently ensure that the policy complies with any requirements which Ofqual has communicated to it in writing.

### Guidance on Conflicts of Interest (including personal interest)

#### What is a Conflict of Interest?

In general terms, a conflict of interest exists when an organisation or an
individual has competing interests, which might impair its or their ability to
make objective, unbiased decisions.

Conflicts of interest can arise in a variety of contexts. Our Conditions cover
conflicts of interest that affect (or could affect) an awarding organisation’s
ability to develop, deliver and award regulated qualifications in a way that
complies with its Conditions of Recognition. We define the term ‘Conflict of
Interest’ in Condition J1 accordingly:

> A Conflict of Interest exists in relation to an awarding organisation where
> –  
>  (a) its interests in any activity undertaken by it, on its behalf, or by a
> member of its Group have the potential to lead it to act contrary to its
> interests in the development, delivery and award of qualifications in a way
> that complies with its Conditions of Recognition,  
>  (b) a person who is connected to the development, delivery or award of
> qualifications by the awarding organisation has interests in any other
> activity which have the potential to lead that person to act contrary to his
> or her interests in that development, delivery or award in a way that
> complies with the awarding organisation’s Conditions of Recognition, or  
>  (c) an informed and reasonable observer would conclude that either of these
> situations was the case.

The three parts of this definition are interrelated.

Part (a) covers Conflicts of Interest that relate to the awarding
organisation. That is, situations where activities carried out by the awarding
organisation itself (or on its behalf, or by a related company) might impair
its ability to make objective, unbiased decisions about how best to develop,
deliver or award its qualifications.

Similarly, part (b) covers Conflicts of Interest that relate to the
individuals [connected to](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-
handbook/section-j-interpretation-and-definitions#condition-j1-7) any part of
the development, delivery or award of its qualifications. That is, situations
where a particular individual’s interests might impair their ability to make
the objective, unbiased decisions that are necessary to ensure the awarding
organisation can develop, deliver and award its qualifications in line with
the Conditions.

Part (c) extends our definition of Conflict of Interest to also include
situations where an observer would perceive that an awarding organisation or
individual has such a competing interest.

#### What requirements must an awarding organisation meet?

Condition A4 imposes a number of obligations on awarding organisations in
relation to Conflicts of Interest. Awarding organisations must:

  * identify and monitor all Conflicts of Interest which relate to it, as well as any scenario in which it is reasonably foreseeable that any such Conflict of Interest will arise in the future (Condition A4.1),
  * establish and maintain an up to date record of all Conflicts of Interest which relate to it (Condition A4.2),
  * take all reasonable steps to ensure no Conflict of Interest which relates to it has an Adverse Effect (Condition A4.3),
  * in any case where a Conflict of Interest nonetheless results in an Adverse Effect, take all reasonable steps to mitigate the Adverse Effect as far as possible and correct it (Condition A4.4), and
  * establish, maintain and comply with a written conflict of interest policy (Condition A4.7).

The Conditions do not impose a general prohibition on an awarding organisation
operating when Conflicts of Interest exist. Rather, they require awarding
organisations to identify, monitor and manage those Conflicts of Interest with
a view to preventing any Adverse Effect that might arise from them, and to
minimise any Adverse Effect should one nonetheless occur.

However, some of the Conditions do prohibit certain Conflicts of Interest in
specific circumstances:

  * Condition A8.3 prohibits anyone with a personal interest in the outcome of an investigation into potential malpractice from carrying out investigations of suspected or alleged malpractice
  * Condition G4.6 prohibits anyone with a personal interest in the outcome of the investigation into potential breaches of confidentiality from carrying out investigations of suspected or alleged breaches of confidentiality
  * Condition I1.2 prohibits anyone with a personal interest in the decision being appealed from taking decisions on that appeal.

In addition, Conditions A4.5 and A4.6 require awarding organisations to take
all reasonable steps to avoid Learners being assessed by anyone with a
personal interest in the outcome of the assessment, and – where it is
unavoidable – to ensure any part of the assessment they do conduct is
scrutinised by someone else who does not have such an interest.

#### What is a personal interest?

A personal interest is a Conflict of Interest that relates to a particular
individual. All Conflicts of Interest that fall under part (b) of our
definition are personal interests, as are any perceived Conflicts of Interest
under part (c) that relate to individuals, rather than to the awarding
organisation itself.

A personal interest can be financial or non-financial in nature.

In the situations covered by Conditions A4.5-A4.6, A8.3, G4.6 and I1.2, the
relevant questions to ask are:

  * Does the individual carrying out the assessment, investigation or appeal have any reason or incentive to make anything other than a decision in line with the relevant Conditions?
  * Would an informed and reasonable observer conclude that such a reason or incentive exists?

#### Examples of situations where Conflicts of Interest and personal interests
exist (or could be perceived to exist)

Example 1  
---  
An awarding organisation produces equipment or materials (such as textbooks)
used in the teaching or assessment of its qualifications.  
  
A Conflict of Interest arises here because the awarding organisation’s
decisions and actions in relation to its qualifications might also affect
those other activities. For example, a decision to revise the content of the
qualification might also create a commercial opportunity for the awarding
organisation to sell new equipment or materials to Centres offering its
qualifications.  
  
In turn, consideration of these other commercial interests could impair – or
be perceived to impair – the awarding organisation’s ability to make
objective, unbiased decisions about how best to develop, deliver or award its
qualifications.  
Example 2  
---  
An awarding organisation is part of a Group, and another company within Group
operates a number of Centres delivering its qualifications.  
  
A Conflict of Interest arises here because the awarding organisation’s
decisions and actions in relation to its qualifications will also affect that
sister company – for example, by imposing costs or administrative burden.  
  
In turn, consideration of the interests of this related company could impair –
or be perceived to impair – the awarding organisation’s ability to make
objective, unbiased decisions about how best to develop, deliver or award its
qualifications.  
  
In particular, the awarding organisation might have – or be perceived to have
– an incentive not to uphold qualification standards if that would advance the
commercial interests of the other Group company.  
Example 3  
---  
Centre staff carry out assessment on behalf of an awarding organisation. The
Centre’s main source of income is payments based on the number of students who
pass the qualification. The pay and reward of Centre staff is directly linked
to the Centre’s overall income.  
  
A Conflict of Interest arises here because an individual Assessor has a
financial incentive to ensure that as many students as possible pass the
qualification, as this will maximise both the Centre’s and their own income.  
  
That incentive could impair – or be perceived to impair – an Assessor’s
ability to make unbiased judgements about the extent to which a student has
demonstrated the required knowledge, skills and understanding. In turn, that
makes it less likely that an Assessor will in fact make an objective and
unbiased decision.  
  
Indeed, in this case Centre staff would most likely have a personal interest
in the outcome of assessments for any students at their Centre, and Condition
A4.5 would require the awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps to
avoid using them as Assessors for those students. If this were unavoidable,
Condition A4.6 would require any such assessment to be scrutinised by another
person.  
Example 4  
---  
An awarding organisation has received an allegation of malpractice, and is
deciding who should investigate it.  
  
Condition A8.3(b) requires investigators to be ‘persons of appropriate
competence’. In this case, one individual who meets that requirement is the
Head of Centre.  
  
Condition A8.3(b) also requires investigations to be undertaken by ‘persons …
who have no personal interest in their outcome’. Whether or not the Head of
Centre has such a personal interest here will depend on the facts of the case.
It will be a matter of judgement for the awarding organisation.  
  
Examples of situations where a Head of Centre has a clear personal interest in
the outcome of an investigation would include cases where:  
• the Head of Centre is accused of, or potentially implicated in, the alleged
malpractice,  
• the Head of Centre is related to, or has a close personal relationship with,
any of the individuals accused of malpractice, and  
• a finding of malpractice would have direct financial consequences for the
Head of Centre (for example, if it would place a performance-related bonus, or
their job, at risk).  
  
Other cases will be less clear-cut, and awarding organisations may need to
consider factors such as the nature, scale and scope of alleged or suspected
malpractice when deciding whether or not the Head of Centre can conduct the
investigation.  
  
In broad terms, a Head of Centre is more likely to have (or be perceived to
have) a personal interest in the outcome of an investigation where the alleged
malpractice is more cultural or systemic.  
  
Another factor awarding organisations may need to consider is the potential
consequences of a finding of malpractice for the Centre (and, by extension,
the Head of Centre). Such findings can affect the outcomes achieved by
Learners, and the Centre’s results in Government performance tables. They can
also result in disciplinary action against Centre staff, which might disrupt
the running of the Centre – significantly so if multiple staff members were
implicated in the malpractice.  
  
The greater the potential impact on the Centre, the more likely it is that the
Head of Centre will have (or be perceived to have) a personal interest in the
outcome of a particular investigation.  
There will also be situations where a member of the Centre’s staff who is not
a Head of Centre could conduct an investigation. They must also meet the
requirements of Condition A8.3(b). Many of the factors outlined above in
respect of whether Heads of Centre have a personal interest in the outcome of
an investigation may similarly be relevant for other Centre staff. Whether or
not an individual has (or would be perceived to have) a personal interest will
be a matter of judgement for the awarding organisation.  
Example 5  
---  
An awarding organisation uses a large pool of markers for its assessments.
Some of the more experienced markers also act as members of a panel which
determines appeals.  
  
One appeal involves a Learner whose work was originally marked by one of the
panel members. A Conflict of Interest arises here in relation to that panel
member – because it is their own marking decisions that are being scrutinised
on appeal.  
  
That also means the panel member would have a personal interest in the
decisions being appealed, because the appeal would determine whether or not
those marking decisions were appropriate.  
  
As a result, Condition I1.2(b) would prohibit that panel member from taking
decisions on this appeal. They would, however, be permitted to adjudicate
appeals for other Learners whose work they had not marked.  
  
In order to comply with Condition I1.2(c), the appeals panel would also need
to include at least one decision maker who was not one of the awarding
organisation’s markers (and was not connected to the awarding organisation in
some other way).  
Example 6  
---  
An awarding organisation pays individuals who determine appeals.  
  
A Conflict of Interest arises here because the fact that the individual is
paid by the awarding organisation (a party to the appeal) creates - or could
be perceived to create - an incentive for the individual to make decisions on
appeal cases that favour the awarding organisation.  
  
In this instance, a degree of Conflict of Interest is largely unavoidable, as
it would be unrealistic to expect the awarding organisation to use unpaid
volunteers to determine appeals. Our rules reflect this, and Condition I1.2(b)
only prohibit individuals from taking decisions on appeals if (as in Example
5) they have a personal interest in the decision being appealed.  
  
Rather, Condition A4 requires the awarding organisation to monitor and manage
that Conflict of Interest to prevent it having an Adverse Effect, and to
mitigate and correct any Adverse Effect that nonetheless occurs.  
  
### Guidance on Condition A4

In the guidance below ‘confidential assessment information’ refers to both the
contents of assessment materials and information about the assessment in
relation to which confidentiality must be maintained under Condition G4.1.

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * ensures that its contractual arrangements with staff and third parties who have access to confidential assessment information clearly set out any obligations on those staff and third parties to manage conflicts of interest arising from other activities that they undertake;
  * puts in place contractual arrangements which require, at a minimum, staff and third parties who have, or have had, access to confidential assessment information through the assessment development process (including quality assurance) to provide details to the awarding organisation of – 
    * all instances in which such a person is, or has been, a Teacher for the relevant qualification, or is employed by a Centre at which that qualification is taught or delivered (even if that person does not themselves teach or deliver the qualification); and
    * all other conflicts of interest including personal conflicts such as, for example – 
      * where a child, sibling, or other close family member is due to take the assessment in relation to which the person has confidential assessment information, and
      * where a partner or other close family member is teaching, or is due to teach, the relevant qualification;
  * requires such details to be provided on an ongoing basis for as long as the relevant assessment information remains confidential;
  * maintains records of all conflicts (using one or more documents) and retains relevant entries for as long as the relevant assessment information remains confidential or as long as required to undertake effective monitoring, whichever is later;
  * puts in place contractual arrangements requiring staff and third parties who have had access to confidential assessment information to promptly notify it if they have been, or are currently, involved in the preparation of a resource designed to support the preparation of Learners for assessments for that qualification. One example of such a resource would be a textbook for the specification. This does not apply to the preparation of teaching resources or materials by a Teacher exclusively for Learners that he or she teaches (although the awarding organisation may choose to look at such materials in order to deter and detect any breach of confidentiality);
  * monitors assessments set by staff and third parties who have been involved in the preparation of a resource designed to support the preparation of Learners for assessments for that qualification, to ensure that the fitness for purpose of those assessments has not been compromised by that resource. One example of such a resource would be a textbook for the specification. This does not apply to the preparation of teaching resources or materials by a Teacher exclusively for Learners that he or she teaches (although the awarding organisation may choose to monitor such materials in order to deter and detect any breach of confidentiality).
  * investigates credible concerns which come to its attention in relation to conflicts of interest.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * did not know that the partner of a staff member involved in the development of confidential assessment information was employed at the time as a Teacher for the qualification for which the assessment would be taken;
  * did not know that a third party who it contracted to develop or quality assure confidential assessment materials was employed at the time as a Teacher for the qualification for which the assessment would be taken;
  * did not know that a third party who it contracted to assist with the development of confidential questions for an assessment – who did not teach the relevant qualification at the time – later became a Teacher of that qualification before the assessment was taken;
  * did not know that a third party who modified confidential assessment materials worked at the time as a private tutor in respect of the qualification for which the assessment would be taken;
  * where a current Teacher holds confidential assessment information, deletes relevant information from its conflicts register where the Teacher stops teaching the relevant qualification before the assessment is taken or before any monitoring takes place

#### Introduction

The successful delivery of examinations and assessments relies on the trust,
integrity and diligence of exams officers, Teachers, Learners, awarding
organisations and their suppliers, and the wider education community – the
vast majority of whom take their responsibilities seriously. Normally the
qualifications system functions well, but occasionally things go wrong. When
this happens, awarding organisations need to investigate, and – where
appropriate – take action, to maintain public confidence, secure accurate
results for Learners and ensure assessments remain fit for purpose.

This guidance covers malpractice and maladministration. Malpractice and
maladministration are specifically dealt with in Condition of Recognition A8.
However, because incidents of malpractice and maladministration will often
touch upon the fitness for purpose of assessments, or the accuracy of marking
or results, other Conditions are often relevant. In this guidance, we explain
how an awarding organisation might prevent, detect and investigate malpractice
and maladministration, and what action to take as a result, drawing attention
to relevant Conditions of Recognition.

This guidance includes some examples to help awarding organisation understand
how they might respond to certain situations. However, the examples are
illustrative and not exhaustive. Awarding Organisations must prevent, detect
and investigate malpractice and maladministration in ways that are appropriate
for their qualifications and assessments, and the specific circumstances of
any case.

#### What is malpractice and maladministration?

Malpractice and maladministration are two distinct, but related, concepts.

In broad terms, maladministration generally covers mistakes or poor process
where there has been no intention on the part of the person responsible to do
any harm. It may involve some degree of incompetence or ineptitude, or may
result from carelessness or inexperience. Whilst not an exhaustive list, the
following are some examples of maladministration in relation to the design,
delivery and awarding of qualifications which an awarding organisation makes
available or proposes to make available:

  * avoidable delay;
  * mistakes arising from inattention;
  * faulty procedures;
  * failure to follow correct procedures;
  * poor record keeping;
  * inadvertent failure to take action;
  * poor communication; and
  * inadvertently giving misleading or inadequate information.

By contrast, malpractice will generally involve some form of intent. It may
also include circumstances where an individual has been negligent or reckless
as to the consequences of their actions. Malpractice could comprise of a
conscious decision to do anything covered in the list above. Bias or
discrimination could also lead to malpractice.

Two of the clearest examples of potential malpractice are:

  * cheating, or facilitating cheating, in an assessment; and
  * attempting intentionally to manipulate a result so that it does not reflect the Learner’s actual performance in an assessment.

Such action could be taken by the Learner themselves, a Teacher, an exams
officer, or any other individual involved in, or with access to, the
assessment process. More specific examples of potential malpractice in
relation to the design, delivery and awarding of qualifications include:

  * revealing the questions on an assessment in advance (where confidentiality is required under [Condition G4.1](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-g-setting-and-delivering-the-assessment));
  * sharing confidential assessment materials ahead of an exam;
  * claiming to have and/or offering to share confidential assessment materials and/or presenting hoax materials as confidential assessment materials;
  * a Learner breaching the rules of the assessment, for example by taking impermissible materials into the assessment;
  * a Learner passing off someone else’s work as their own;
  * a Teacher providing a Learner with answers, providing assistance to Learners beyond what is permitted, or deliberately failing to apply the mark scheme to a Learner’s answer; and
  * a Teacher or Learner falsifying a result.

Although malpractice and maladministration are distinct, the two concepts can
be on a spectrum. As such, they will sometimes shade into one another.

For the purpose of an awarding organisation complying with our rules it may
not be particularly relevant whether a specific incident is classified as
malpractice or maladministration. Regardless of where on the spectrum any
incident is, the requirements set out in the Conditions remain the same.

#### Identifying risk and preventing malpractice and maladministration

##### (a) Identifying risk

Condition A6.1 requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps
to identify the risk of any incidents which could have an Adverse Effect.
Where they relate to the integrity of assessments or the accuracy of results,
incidents of malpractice and maladministration may almost always have an
Adverse Effect. Other forms of malpractice or maladministration may also have
an Adverse Effect depending on the circumstances. Adverse Effect is a defined
term under [Condition J1.8](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-
handbook/section-j-interpretation-and-definitions).

An integral part of an awarding organisation’s compliance with Condition A6.1
will therefore be identifying the risks of malpractice and maladministration.
In considering those risks an awarding organisation should take into account
the following factors alongside the existing Guidance that currently supports
A6.1.

  * The types of malpractice or maladministration risk that are relevant to the awarding organisation’s qualifications. For example, whether confidentiality in assessment questions is required, or whether it would unfairly benefit a Learner to take a particular prohibited item into the assessment. What steps may be necessary to prevent this?
  * Any aspects of the qualification’s design or delivery, or the processes used by the awarding organisation that could increase the likelihood of malpractice or maladministration. For example, whether: 
    * Learners have the opportunity to obtain inappropriate assistance from Teachers or others in completing assessments;
    * the delivery of question papers to the awarding organisation is appropriately secure;
    * the security of assessment materials relies on the competence and integrity of Centre staff, such as exams officers; or
    * whether the marking process makes it possible to falsify marks.
  * Who might become involved in malpractice or maladministration. For example, whether the risks lie with those designing, printing or delivering assessment materials, Learners, Teachers, administrative staff involved in the delivery of exams, exams officers, or particular Centres or Assessors.
  * The likelihood that malpractice or maladministration will take place. For example, the benefit to the perpetrator of engaging in a particular type of malpractice or maladministration, the motivation/ incentive that may exist to engage in such behaviour and the perceived likelihood of being caught and the subsequent consequences.
  * Where assessments take place. For example, where qualifications are sat internationally and exam papers need to be transported overseas and go through any customs procedures.
  * The likely impact of any malpractice or maladministration on the awarding organisation’s ability to comply with its Conditions of Recognition. For example, whether the design of a particular assessment means that the leak of a question would require the entire assessment to be substituted for all Learners, and the ease with which that could be accomplished.
  * Any data or other intelligence which can be used to identify the risk of malpractice and maladministration occurring. For example, considering, and where appropriate combining, data sets relating to entries, results, malpractice and maladministration, and access arrangements to spot patterns and unusual behaviour and inform the identification of risk.

##### (b) Preventing malpractice and maladministration

Having identified any risks of malpractice or maladministration, Conditions
A6.2 and A8.1 require the awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps
to prevent any malpractice or maladministration from occurring.

An awarding organisation should have in place, and adhere to, ways of working
that reduce the risk of incidents of malpractice or maladministration,
ensuring its Workforce understands and follows the relevant arrangements. As
part of an awarding organisation’s obligations under Condition C1.1, it must
ensure that third parties involved in the development, delivery and award of
its qualifications understand and routinely follow such ways of working. It
must also monitor the work undertaken by third parties under such
arrangements.

The arrangements should include coverage of the following, as relevant:

  * plagiarism, collusion, tampering, breach of confidentiality of assessment materials; and
  * incidents that could occur wherever regulated qualifications are taken.

Compliance with Conditions A6.2 and A8.1 requires that such arrangements are
as effective as reasonably possible. It is not enough to have an arrangement
in place if it is not appropriate to the risks of malpractice and
maladministration to which a particular qualification gives rise.

Depending on the qualification, reasonable steps to prevent malpractice or
maladministration may include, but are not limited to, the following:

  * Education and information. The awarding organisation should provide appropriate training and/or information on ways of working and arrangements to prevent malpractice and maladministration to, amongst others: their Workforce; Learners; Centres, including specific training and/ or information for key members of staff such as the head of Centre, and exams officers; and Teachers. For example, awarding organisations should consider the level of guidance given to those conducting assessments to ensure they are fully aware of the rules and conditions under which non-exam, work-based, or practical assessments must be conducted. This might include information for Centres on the support and feedback a Teacher may provide. It might also include information for Learners on what constitutes plagiarism and the consequences if they plagiarise.
  * Designing out opportunities for malpractice and maladministration. Awarding organisations should design qualifications and processes to reduce, as far as reasonably possible, the opportunity for malpractice and maladministration to occur. For example, requiring a second check on assessment materials before they are handed out, or clearly labelling and promptly removing outdated assessment materials from their website in order to reduce the risk of maladministration.
  * Centre checks being undertaken with appropriate regularity and rigour. This is likely to include more regular checks for Centres that may be deemed at higher risk of committing malpractice or maladministration, such as new Centres or those where particular issues have been identified. Awarding organisations might decide not to work with certain Centres where they deem the risks of malpractice and maladministration to be too great.
  * Securing the behaviour and action they would expect from third parties and partner organisations. An awarding organisation should seek to support a culture of risk identification, prevention and reporting concerns by, and within, third parties and Centres.
  * Any other appropriate safeguards. In line with Condition A8.1, awarding organisations should use appropriate safeguards for the particular qualifications they provide to prevent malpractice and maladministration. Awarding organisations should look to test, evaluate and develop these safeguards over time to ensure they are fit for purpose.

An awarding organisation should take appropriate steps to ensure that its
policies and practices are working effectively to prevent malpractice and
maladministration as part of their risk management process. Awarding
organisations might test the effectiveness of such measures by, for example:

  * Monitoring and sampling. An awarding organisation should appropriately monitor and sample areas that might be high risk, focussing its monitoring on qualifications and/ or Centres with a history of malpractice or maladministration and taking into account relevant information provided by another awarding organisation under Condition A8.7 (b). This may also include scrutiny of assessment materials so that malpractice or maladministration can be identified.
  * Using data, feedback and internal audits to make sure their processes are working well. The process of preventing, detecting, investigating and sanctioning malpractice and maladministration can be viewed as cyclical. Where, despite measures in place, malpractice or maladministration does occur, an awarding organisation should learn from the occurrence to inform a new risk analysis and to decide how to reduce the risk of reoccurrence, in compliance with Conditions A6.2, A8.1 and D3.

See Example 1 below

#### Supporting Centres in their approach to malpractice and maladministration

[Condition C2.5](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-c-third-
parties) requires an awarding organisation to provide effective guidance to
their Centres on how the qualifications should be delivered. Under Condition
A8.5 awarding organisations must provide any additional, and potentially more
focused, guidance on request by the Centre. An awarding organisation must
respond to a request from a Centre to provide it with guidance on how best to
prevent, investigate and deal with malpractice and maladministration.

However, an awarding organisation might sometimes need to do more than provide
guidance to a Centre to discharge its duties under Conditions A6, A7, and A8.
For example, where it judges that the Centre cannot manage the issue itself,
the awarding organisation might step in, in line with the requirement of
Condition A8.1, to take all reasonable steps to prevent malpractice and
maladministration.

#### Detecting malpractice and maladministration

Condition A8.2(a) requires that where malpractice or maladministration is
suspected by an awarding organisation or alleged by any other person, and
where there are reasonable grounds for that suspicion or allegation, the
awarding organisation must, so far as possible, establish whether the
malpractice or maladministration has occurred. Indeed, it will sometimes only
be through investigation that an awarding organisation can determine the
credibility of the allegation and what has occurred.

An awarding organisation should have a consistent, structured approach to
dealing with allegations and suspicions. This includes having clear policies
and procedures in place to allow information received from individuals and/or
organisations to be handled and used effectively

When an allegation or suspicion comes to light, the awarding organisation
should act quickly to secure any relevant evidence and information to support
its judgements. When deciding whether reasonable grounds for a suspicion or
allegation exist, an awarding organisation should consider any relevant
factors, including the following:

  * the initial information provided with the allegation or other information which gives rise to the suspicion;
  * the source of any allegation;
  * any evidence that may reduce the credibility of the allegation;
  * any previous allegations, suspicions or evidence that may support, or contradict, the facts or information presented; an awarding organisation should cross-reference allegations made against existing records;
  * any previous relevant investigations in relation to a Centre, whether or not a finding of malpractice or maladministration was made; this should also include details it holds of any investigations into the Centre by another awarding organisation; and
  * the time between the alleged malpractice or maladministration and the date the allegation was made.

Awarding organisations should, in accordance with Condition A5.2 (b), keep a
log of all allegations and suspicions of malpractice and maladministration,
along with records of investigations, eventual decisions on the existence of
malpractice and maladministration and how each decision was reached. Awarding
organisations should also consider retaining any additional information to
allow them to identify patterns of behaviour relating to malpractice and
maladministration over time, in line with the requirement under Condition A6.1
to take all reasonable steps to identify the risk of the occurrence of any
incident which could have an Adverse Effect.

Where the awarding organisation holds information relevant to its compliance
with the Conditions it should consider the period for which it should retain
this.

See Example 2 below

#### Notifying Ofqual

An awarding organisation must promptly notify Ofqual when it has cause to
believe that an event has occurred, or is likely to occur, which could have an
Adverse Effect.

Under [Condition B3.2(g)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-
b-the-awarding-organisation-and-ofqual) an awarding organisation has a
particular obligation to promptly notify Ofqual where it has cause to believe
that there has been an incident of malpractice or maladministration, which
could either invalidate the award of a qualification which it makes available,
or could affect another awarding organisation.  
In all cases, [Condition B3.1](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-
handbook/section-b-the-awarding-organisation-and-ofqual) requires that Ofqual
be notified promptly. Under Condition B3.6 the awarding organisation must not
wait until it has the full picture before informing Ofqual. Therefore, where
an awarding organisation has cause to believe that malpractice or
maladministration has, or is likely to, occur, and that this could have an
Adverse Effect, it should not wait until it has completed any investigation
before notifying Ofqual. Where there is a credible allegation of suspected
malpractice or maladministration that could constitute criminal activity, an
awarding organisation may wish to consider whether they should notify the
police as well as notifying Ofqual under [Condition
B3.1](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-b-the-awarding-
organisation-and-ofqual).

#### Investigating malpractice and maladministration

Once the awarding organisation has established that there are reasonable
grounds for the suspicion or allegation, it must ensure a rigorous and
effective investigation is carried out. Usually an investigation will be more
effective if it is carried out promptly.

Under Condition A8.3(a) an awarding organisation must establish, maintain and
comply with up to date written procedures for investigating such allegations
or suspicions.

An awarding organisation should use, and regularly review, its written
procedures, which may take the form of a standardised investigations policy
and approach, which should address, but is not limited to:

  * who investigates concerns about malpractice or maladministration;
  * how an investigation is undertaken, including how it will be conducted so as to ensure the preservation and integrity of evidence;
  * how whistleblowers will be treated, and how prejudice towards them will be avoided;
  * when and how anyone suspected of malpractice or maladministration will be notified about the investigation and given a right to supply evidence and respond to any preliminary findings;
  * when and how interested parties will be notified of any issues which may affect them and be given an opportunity to make submissions;
  * how any interviews will be conducted;
  * how facts will be gathered and evidence found, collated and stored;
  * how evidence will be verified;
  * how the confidentiality of investigation materials will be ensured;
  * how the outcomes of its investigations will be presented and their accuracy assured;
  * how and when any visits to Centres will be announced and undertaken;
  * what principles will be followed when it undertakes an investigation with other bodies; and
  * any other relevant information as required.

Awarding organisations should not presume that the Centre is always best
placed to complete an investigation. Under Condition A8.3(b) an awarding
organisation must ensure that investigations are carried out rigorously,
effectively, and by persons of appropriate competence who have no personal
interest in their outcome.

This will require consideration of a number of issues on a case-by-case basis,
including the potential scale and scope of the investigation, and the
competence, capacity and personal interest of anyone who will complete any
part of the investigation.

##### (a) Scale and scope of the investigation

The scale and scope of the investigation will have an impact on who is best
placed to complete the investigation. Awarding organisations should take into
account:

  * The nature of the possible malpractice or maladministration, for example, whether the issue relates to a breach of confidentiality in the design stage, cheating in assessments or problems at the marking or any grading stage.
  * The number of Learners involved, if any, in the alleged malpractice or maladministration and the number directly advantaged, or disadvantaged, by the alleged malpractice or maladministration.
  * The degree of potential advantage or disadvantage to Learners involved in, or affected by, the alleged malpractice or maladministration.
  * The extent to which Teachers or other professionals may be involved in the alleged malpractice or maladministration as this will help to determine the degree of any personal interest, as outlined below.
  * The extent to which the allegation or suspicion suggests any level of knowledge or awareness of the suspected malpractice or maladministration at Centre level.
  * The number of Centres involved.
  * The potential impact on public confidence in the qualification, or regulated qualifications more widely, of the suspected issue if confirmed.
  * Any potential impact on public confidence if Centre staff have a role in the investigation.
  * The degree to which alleged malpractice or maladministration may disadvantage other Learners.
  * The number of other Learners that may be affected by the alleged malpractice or maladministration, and the potential impact on them, as this might influence the effect on public confidence.

The extent to which each factor is relevant, and whether any others should be
considered, will vary, as will the appropriate weight to be given to any
relevant factor.

##### (b) Competence and capacity

An awarding organisation should make sure its investigators are competent to
complete the investigation in line with its potential scale and complexity. It
should make sure its investigators have appropriate skills and experience
including, as appropriate, in:

  * gathering and recording evidence from interviews;
  * gathering evidence from minors, vulnerable adults and those with learning difficulties;
  * protecting, gathering and retaining evidence from documentation and electronic sources;
  * the information that should be given to those suspected of being engaged with malpractice or maladministration;
  * when and how to involve other authorities including the police where criminal activity is suspected; and
  * safeguarding.

In line with the requirement under Condition A8.3 (b) for an investigation to
be both rigorous and effective, where an individual has the appropriate
competence, awarding organisations should also consider the capacity of the
individual to undertake an investigation. The awarding organisation should
consider:

  * the capacity of the individual to undertake the investigation promptly; and
  * the time required and available capacity of the individual.

Under Condition A5.2(a), an awarding organisation must establish and maintain
a Workforce of appropriate size and competence. As a result, awarding
organisations should seek to have appropriate and sufficient access to trained
investigators so that this resource is available should it be required.

##### (c) Personal interest

Under Condition A8.3 (b), awarding organisations must ensure that
investigations are carried out by individuals with no personal interest in
their outcome. The definition of the term Conflict of Interest can be found in
[Condition J1](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-j-
interpretation-and-definitions). A personal interest is a Conflict of Interest
that relates to a particular individual. An awarding organisation must ensure
that anyone who conducts the investigation has no personal interest in its
outcome. Particular care must be taken when judging whether an individual
within the Centre is best placed to conduct an investigation given the greater
risk of an actual or perceived Conflict of Interest in that context. Further
guidance around personal interest, and making a judgement as to whether this
exists, can be found in the guidance to Condition A4, including a specific
example of where individuals in a Centre may not be well placed to investigate
a specific incident.

Awarding organisations should consider the scale and scope of the suspected or
alleged malpractice or maladministration, competence, and personal interest
when identifying who is best placed to investigate a suspicion or allegation
and when deciding who should gather evidence to support an investigation. As
judgements about malpractice and maladministration will be based on any
evidence gathered, these considerations are as relevant to who collects
evidence as they are to who takes decisions based on that evidence.

See Examples 3 and 4 below

#### Taking appropriate action where malpractice or maladministration is
suspected or alleged

##### (a) Relevant Conditions

Awarding organisations must comply with [Conditions H5.1 and H6.1
(d)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-h-from-marking-to-
issuing-results). These Conditions require an awarding organisation to ensure
that the result of each assessment reflects the level of attainment
demonstrated by a Learner and to issue results which accurately and completely
reflect the marking of assessments. The action taken by an awarding
organisation in a suspected or alleged case of malpractice or
maladministration must be geared towards achieving this so as to fully comply
with these Conditions.

In particular:

  * Condition A8.2(b) requires awarding organisations to promptly take all reasonable steps to prevent any Adverse Effect to which it may give rise;
  * where such an Adverse Effect nonetheless arises, Condition A8.2(b) also requires an awarding organisation to promptly take all reasonable steps to mitigate the Adverse Effect as far as possible and correct it; and
  * because cases of suspected or alleged malpractice and maladministration are (necessarily) examples of an incident that could have an Adverse Effect, then Condition A7.1 (b) also requires the awarding organisation to ‘give priority to the provision of assessments which accurately differentiate between Learners on the basis of the level of attainment they have demonstrated and to the accurate and timely award of qualifications’.

Conditions A7.1(a) and A8.2(b) require an awarding organisation to take all
reasonable steps to prevent any Adverse Effect that may result, or where an
Adverse Effect occurs, mitigate it as far as possible.

##### (b) Factors to consider

Where malpractice or maladministration is suspected but no determination has
yet been made, an awarding organisation should consider whether to take any
precautionary steps to reduce the potential for an Adverse Effect. When
deciding what steps might be appropriate it should take into account:

  * The intended use of the qualification. For example, for professional qualifications and qualifications which confer a licence to practise, suspected malpractice or maladministration may call into question whether an individual has demonstrated the required level of competence. Where this is the case, the potential Adverse Effect of allowing the individual to practise may outweigh any Adverse Effects on the individual of delaying their entry into their profession or gaining their licence to practise. Any health and safety or safeguarding issues will be relevant in this regard.
  * Any time scales involved, for example, where the qualification may be used to apply for or enter higher education.
  * The scale and scope of the possible malpractice or maladministration.
  * Any potential risk to other qualifications as a result of the possible malpractice or maladministration.
  * Whether there are additional risks that might arise as a result of the suspected malpractice or maladministration. For example, where a Teacher is suspected of malpractice or maladministration, whether allowing them to continue to deliver assessments increases the risk of further incidents.
  * Any legal implications arising from actions in each case.

Under Condition A7.1(b), where any incident occurs which could have an Adverse
Effect, an awarding organisation must promptly take all reasonable steps to
give priority to the provision of assessments which accurately differentiate
between Learners on the basis of the level of attainment they have
demonstrated and to the accurate and timely award of qualifications. In the
case of malpractice or maladministration, this Condition requires the awarding
organisation to give priority to ensuring that it provides assessments that
are fit for purpose. For example, should a large-scale security breach of
assessment materials occur prior to an assessment, an awarding organisation
may initially focus on distributing alternative materials where possible, in
order to meet this obligation.

In line with the overarching objective outlined above, where malpractice or
maladministration is suspected or alleged prior to the issue of results, an
awarding organisation must consider whether it should delay the issue of any
or all results. In this respect, the absolute obligations to ensure that
results are correct in [Conditions H5.1 and H6.1
(d)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-h-from-marking-to-
issuing-results) are stronger obligations than the duty to take all reasonable
steps to comply with a timescale for issuing results in [Condition H6.1
(f)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-h-from-marking-to-
issuing-results). For example, it may not be reasonable to issue a result
which is highly likely to be incorrect simply to meet a published date.
Likewise, the requirement for the issue of results to be timely under
[Condition H6.1 (e)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-h-
from-marking-to-issuing-results) means that results should be issued at the
earliest appropriate time, not simply as soon as possible. The use to which a
qualification is put will be a relevant factor in considering timeliness.

An awarding organisation is under an obligation to issue results for all units
and qualifications under [Condition H6.1](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-
handbook/section-h-from-marking-to-issuing-results) and this means that it
cannot withhold results indefinitely. However, an awarding organisation can
conclude that a result should not be issued where the malpractice or
maladministration affected the level of attainment demonstrated by the
Learner.

We will expect awarding organisations to carefully consider the balance
between its obligations when deciding whether to withhold results, using some
of the factors highlighted above when making such decisions.

A similar balancing exercise will be required where malpractice or
maladministration is alleged or suspected following the issue of results but
prior to the issue of certificates.

In accordance with [Condition B3.5](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-
handbook/section-b-the-awarding-organisation-and-ofqual), the awarding
organisation has a continuing obligation to notify Ofqual as soon as possible
of any steps that it has taken or intends to take to prevent an Adverse
Effect, or to correct or mitigate any Adverse Effect that occurs.

#### Taking appropriate action once malpractice or maladministration is
established

Under Condition A8.6 (b), where malpractice or maladministration is
established, an awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to take
action, or seek the cooperation of others in taking such action. Awarding
organisations are required to ensure that the action is proportionate to the
gravity and scope of the malpractice or maladministration found.

Proportionate action can only be taken once the facts of the case have been
established. Awarding organisations should therefore consider all relevant
information when determining what action to take on a case-by-case basis. In
all cases awarding organisations should consider consequential effects,
including the effect of the proposed action on the individual or centre, when
judging which action(s) are proportionate. An awarding organisation must
balance the consequences for the individual or Centre against the seriousness
and effects of the malpractice or maladministration. This does not preclude
the use of a sanctions matrix or similar, but does require the consequential
factors in each individual case to be considered when judging whether or which
sanction(s) are proportionate.

Under [Condition H6.3 (b)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-
handbook/section-h-from-marking-to-issuing-results), where an awarding
organisation discovers that a result is incorrect, it must consider whether to
correct it, having regard to the relevant
[Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-h-from-marking-
to-issuing-results).

Under [Condition I4.2(c)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-
i-appeals-and-certificates), an awarding organisation must take all reasonable
steps to ensure that it revokes any certificate if the result on the
certificate is false because of malpractice or maladministration. It should
consider how it will contact the Learners involved to notify them of the
status of their certificates and of any arrangements for re-assessment and/or
certification, as well as their right of appeal.

#### Review of decisions relating to malpractice and maladministration

[Condition I1.1c](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-i-
appeals-and-certificates) (alternatively for GCSE, AS/A level and Project
qualifications, Qualification Level Condition GCSE18.2(d), GCE18.2(d) and
Project12.2(d) respectively) requires an awarding organisation to establish,
maintain and comply with an appeals process in relation to its qualifications.
This must provide for the appeal of decisions relating to any action to be
taken against a Learner or a Centre following an investigation into
malpractice or maladministration. Learners should be informed of decisions
relating to action to be taken against them following an investigation into
malpractice or maladministration, together with the supporting reasons. Where
information concerns third parties, awarding organisations should consider
what information may be shared lawfully.  
The awarding organisation might inform the Learner directly or require the
Centre to do so.

Where awarding organisations face difficulties contacting Learners – once
results have been issued, for example, due to Centre closure, or other factors
– awarding organisations should take all reasonable steps to contact them.

Where the awarding organisation finds that a Teacher has committed malpractice
the awarding organisation should consider, where appropriate, notifying the
Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA), or any organisation that carries out the
same function in England or another jurisdiction. In considering whether such
a referral is appropriate, the awarding organisation should consider any
guidance issued by the appropriate regulator and whether:

  * the Teacher is subject to professional regulation by the TRA or other teaching regulator; and
  * the malpractice is serious based on the facts of the case and the seriousness of the sanction imposed.

If the awarding organisation has evidence that any Centre at which the Teacher
is employed has made a referral to the TRA, it does not need to make a
referral. Where there is doubt, the awarding organisation should make a
referral itself. Where confidential information is disclosed by an individual
who is not subject to regulation by the TRA or another teaching regulator, the
awarding organisation should notify any other professional regulator to which
that person is subject, where appropriate.

#### What should an awarding organisation do after deciding what action to
take?

[Condition D3.3](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-d-
general-requirements-for-regulated-qualifications) requires that where an
event relating to an awarding organisation has had an Adverse Effect, it must
review, and revise where necessary, its approach to the development, delivery
and award of qualifications to ensure it remains appropriate. This could
include, for example, putting in place new safeguards, changing the design of
a qualification, revising how it develops new qualifications and/ or providing
further information and/or guidance. The awarding organisation should
consider, in particular, if it should improve its controls or approach to
malpractice or maladministration. This should be a cyclical process where an
awarding organisation uses the incident to inform the identification of future
risks under Condition A6.1. In accordance with Condition A6, an awarding
organisation should also consider whether to update its contingency plan.

#### Examples

Example 1  
---  
For one of an awarding organisation’s qualifications, Learners receive
training on the job and complete assessments at a Centre.  
  
One possible form of malpractice is an individual impersonating the Learner
entered for the assessment. The awarding organisation (correctly) considers
the risk is greater for this qualification because Learners have no existing
relationship with the Centre at which they take the assessment.  
  
Reasonable steps the awarding organisation might take to prevent this form of
malpractice might include:  
• requiring that students show formal identification before they enter the
assessment room, and that the relevant identification is checked each time
they sit an assessment,  
• having procedures where Centres can raise concerns with the Awarding
Organisation about the identification presented, which trigger additional
checks on identification before the Learner receives a result,  
• issuing resources to Centres to display highlighting the penalties for
malpractice,  
• providing guidance to Centres on verifying a Learner’s identity,  
• regular, effective monitoring of the processes in place at Centres
delivering the qualifications to ensure policies and practices in place are
functioning as intended, and  
• reviewing policies and procedures in the light of any instances of
malpractice, or examples of good practice, found during such monitoring.  
  
This example relates to a specific risk and a specific qualification. However,
the approach of considering the specific risks of malpractice and
maladministration, devising policies and procedures to prevent those risks
crystallising, reviewing whether those policies and procedures are working,
and making relevant changes as appropriate, is equally applicable for other
risks and qualifications.  
  
Go back  
Example 2  
---  
A teacher has contacted an awarding organisation to allege that the head
teacher of a school is opening exam papers on receipt and using the
information to provide revision sessions for students. They provide further
information, including detailed timings in relation to the allegation. The
allegation was received 6 months after the alleged incident. The awarding
organisation reviewed records of previous allegations and discovered two
previous allegations of malpractice against the school.  
  
The earlier allegations were made by parents of students at the school, and
both were in relation to students being given inappropriate help from
invigilators in exams. Both claims were investigated by the head of centre and
insufficient evidence was found to support either allegation. Although
previous investigations of other allegations did not find sufficient evidence
to make a finding of malpractice, these had been undertaken by the head of
centre who is implicated in the recent allegation. Whilst there has been some
delay between the alleged incident and its reporting, both the teacher raising
the concern, and the headteacher are still working at the school. On balance,
given the level of detail provided by the alleger, the awarding organisation
is likely to believe reasonable grounds exist to investigate the allegation.  
  
Go back  
Example 3  
---  
It is reported that a student has been found with a mobile phone in a language
speaking exam. There was no suggestion that they intended to use the device.
The awarding organisation was notified by the head of centre. Any decision as
to who is best placed to investigate should not be made on the basis of who
reported the malpractice or maladministration; this does not indicate whether
the individual has appropriate competence and no personal interest, which is a
requirement of the Conditions.  
  
The awarding organisation should consider establishing some initial facts to
enable it to consider the question of how such an incident should be
approached. There is no suggestion in the allegation that this was anything
other than an isolated incident involving one student in the one Centre. There
is no personal relationship between the head of centre and the student
involved beyond the professional relationship that would be expected in this
situation. Whilst there is in such a case the potential for a Conflict of
Interest as a result of the potential of a finding of malpractice to impact on
the grades achieved in the exam by the student, and as such an impact on the
school, the scale and scope of the alleged malpractice in this case lowers
this risk. As such, provided that the awarding organisation is confident that
the head of centre has the appropriate competence to gather statements
appropriately and is independent from the incident to avoid any actual or
perceived conflict, it may be appropriate for the head of centre to gather
evidence in this case.  
  
However, in cases where the incident itself is similar, but for example
involves a greater number of students within the school, or implicates staff
members, or there may have been repeated incidents of a similar nature, this
would change the scale and scope of the investigation and the awarding
organisation would need to consider whether the same investigator would be
appropriate as this may affect the potential for conflict of interest and a
potential need for greater competence.  
  
Go back  
Example 4  
---  
It is alleged that 20 students at a centre have been given extra time in which
to complete an exam without there being any evidence they are entitled to a
Reasonable Adjustment. The allegation suggests that the same has happened in
the last two years and that a total of over 50 students had been involved. The
current SENCo, is a member of the senior leadership team, and has been in post
for the last three years.  
  
Given that the allegation involves staff at the Centre, and could have
potential implications for student outcomes should malpractice be proven,
there is the potential that any individual staff member within the Centre may
have a conflict of interest in this case. Any investigation would need to be
carried out by a person familiar with Reasonable Adjustments arrangements so
they are competent to undertake such an investigation. As the investigation
might involve interviews with SEND students, and potentially vulnerable
students, the investigator would need appropriate skills and experience
engaging with such students.  
  
It is likely that an external investigator would be required, as those within
the centre would not be best placed to gather the evidence. Where an awarding
organisation does not have appropriate skills and competence within their own
workforce, they may consider it necessary to seek support from a third party.

organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * identifies events that have occurred or are likely to occur that could have, or has had, an Adverse Effect and notifies Ofqual promptly;
  * has staff who take timely, informed decisions and exercise appropriate judgement when deciding when to report events to Ofqual, and when managing events;
  * notifies Ofqual of events that have occurred or are likely to occur that could have, or has had, an Adverse Effect irrespective of whether the event is being managed through established contingency plans;
  * has clear decision-making and timely escalation processes for identifying and determining whether an event could have, or has had, an Adverse Effect;
  * balances the need to gather sufficient evidence to identify whether an Adverse Effect has occurred or is likely to occur, with the need promptly to notify Ofqual of the event, prioritising prompt notification over waiting for all evidence to be available, taking account of: 
    * the actual or potential impact on Learners;
    * its assessment of the seriousness of the event, taking account of the factors set out in the guidance on making a notification below;
    * the urgency of any actions required to mitigate the actual or potential Adverse Effect (for example, because of proximity to an assessment on a specific date, or to the issuing of results or certificates);
    * how long it will take the awarding organisation to gather evidence and decide on, and take, key decisions or actions;
    * the actual or potential impact on public confidence, such as if the event has been or is likely to be reported in the media or on social media;
  * provides information to Ofqual when making a notification that includes: 
    * what has happened or is likely to happen and why;
    * how and when it became aware of the event;
    * its assessment of the seriousness of the event and of its actual or potential Adverse Effect, and the basis on which this assessment was made, taking account of any information from Ofqual (for example if Ofqual has asked for specific information about certain types of event) about how particular types of event should be reported;
    * the possible or actual impact of the event on Learners or public confidence (in terms of both the type of Learner(s) affected and volume of Learners affected), including any impact on the standards or validity of qualifications;
    * the actions it has taken or plans to take to prevent, correct or mitigate as far as is possible any actual or potential Adverse Effect, to identify its cause and to prevent the event from reoccurring;
    * the qualifications, subjects and units affected, including the dates and details of any affected assessments;
    * its assessment of the scale of the event including, where possible, the number of Centres and Learners affected, with a country location breakdown;
    * any relevant supporting information or documents relating to the event, for example, copies of assessment materials in the case of question paper errors or details of system failures in the event of an issue with an online assessment system;
    * how it is monitoring the event to ensure its assessment of the seriousness remains accurate and that its actions remain appropriate;
    * whether Centres, Learners, media or other stakeholders are aware and details of any complaints or correspondence it has received about the event;
    * the expected timescales for resolving and/or mitigating the impact of the event;
    * how it will keep Ofqual informed throughout its management of the event;
    * any other organisations or agencies that are involved;
  * provides sufficiently detailed information to enable Ofqual to understand the nature of the event and the actions taken by the awarding organisation;
  * where full information is not available at the point when the awarding organisation notifies Ofqual, provides an indication of what further information will be provided and when;
  * in supplying information to Ofqual, takes account of requirements relating to the protection of personal information, and where relevant, the need to protect the confidentiality of assessment materials;
  * provides regular updates and relevant information as agreed with Ofqual, throughout its management of the event;
  * keeps its decisions about whether or not an event has an actual or potential Adverse Effect under review as circumstances and/or its understanding of the event change;
  * notifies Ofqual of any event under B3.3 sufficiently far ahead of any changes taking place and provides relevant supporting evidence as required by Ofqual, which could include: 
    * a description of any changes which are being made;
    * relevant documents which confirm any changes or the likely nature of potential changes;
    * plans for how the awarding organisation will ensure that no Learners are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged as a result of any change;
    * the steps it will take to make sure it will remain compliant with its Conditions of Recognition;
  * notifies Ofqual (as required by Condition B3.4) of its plans to offer qualifications which are substantially different before it starts marketing, promoting or offering them, for example when it intends to offer qualifications: 
    * of a nature which it does not have experience offering;
    * in a sector for which it has not previously offered qualifications;
    * at a level which it has not previously offered qualifications;
    * using a method of assessment it has not previously used.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * does not have a clear and effective process for managing event notifications;
  * fails to inform Ofqual promptly and provide sufficient detail of events which have had, or could have an Adverse Effect;
  * does not notify Ofqual of an event which has had, or could have an Adverse Effect before Ofqual becomes aware of it through other means (for example through complaints by Learners or Centres, media reports or reports from other agencies) where it would have been possible to do so;
  * does not provide regular and timely updates for an event which it has reported, as it manages the event;
  * does not manage event notifications effectively, leading to a delayed or inappropriate resolution which adversely impacts Learners, public confidence or standards;
  * experiences reoccurrences of the same or similar event where this could have been prevented;
  * does not respond fully or accurately to requests from Ofqual for further information;
  * provides inaccurate reports of events that could have an Adverse Effect, such as: 
    * inaccurate reporting of the number of events which occur;
    * inaccurate or misleading assessments of the seriousness of the event;
  * does not alert Ofqual to a material change in its governance or ownership or until after the event;
  * does not alert Ofqual when it becomes evident its financial security is at risk;
  * does not alert Ofqual to its plans to introduce substantially different qualifications sufficiently far ahead of submitting them to the Register (to allow Ofqual to consider the need for any additional requirements that may apply, such as an accreditation requirement or special condition), or where an accreditation requirement applies, before it submits them for accreditation (to allow time for the accreditation of that qualification);
  * starts marketing a qualification, registering Learners or offering a qualification that is substantially different in type or content to any qualification it has previously made available before notifying Ofqual of its intentions.

## Condition B4 - Notice to provide information to Ofqual

  1. B4.1 Where Ofqual serves a written notice on an awarding organisation requiring the awarding organisation to provide it with any information that it seeks for the purpose of performing its functions, the awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) comply with the terms of that notice, and
    2. (b) ensure that all information provided to Ofqual in response to such a notice is accurate and complete.

  1. B4.2 Any such notice may include terms which –

    11. (k) specify a process to be followed in any withdrawal of the Centre (whether voluntary or not) from its role in delivering a qualification, and
    12. (l) require the Centre to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of Learners in the case of such a withdrawal.

  1. C2.4 In the event that the Centre withdraws from its role in delivering a qualification, the awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of Learners.

  1. C2.5 The awarding organisation must, in respect of the parts of the delivery of qualifications which the Centre undertakes: 
    1. (a) provide effective guidance to the Centre, and
    2. (b) make available to the Centre any information which, for the purposes of that delivery, the Centre may reasonably require to be provided by the awarding organisation.

  1. C2.6 An awarding organisation must: 
    1. (a) in respect of any GCSE qualification, GCE qualification, advanced extension award qualification and project qualification which it makes available, take all reasonable steps promptly to ensure that – 
      1. (i) the attention of each Centre with which it has an agreement is drawn to the document published by Ofqual, and updated from time to time, entitled ‘[Guidance on collecting evidence of student performance to ensure resilience in the qualifications system for GCSE, AS and A levels, Project Qualifications and AEA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-collecting-evidence-of-student-performance-to-ensure-resilience-in-the-qualifications-system)’, and

      2. (ii) where it does consider such evidence gathering to be appropriate, provide guidance to the Centre in relation to that evidence.

### Guidance on Condition C2

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * sets out clearly to Centres what it requires them to do, making necessary information available and providing appropriate support and guidance (for example training and/or publications), including: 
    * the requirements the Centre must meet, including those relating to the Centre’s staff;
    * the requirements the Centre must meet and the steps it must take in the event of any incident;
    * its requirements for the delivery of any part of a qualification that a Centre undertakes on its behalf, for example arrangements for security of assessments, conduct of assessments and examinations, managing assessment and examination timetabling, management of centre-assessed work and authentication of Learners;
    * its arrangements for a Centre to report to the awarding organisation instances where its requirements are not being met;
    * any service level agreements between the awarding organisation and the Centre (for example entry requirements, registration of learners and applications for Reasonable Adjustments and Special Consideration);
    * any requirements relating to the use of third parties by Centres (for example satellite centres or training providers);
    * its arrangements for Centres to identify, investigate and report cases of suspected or actual malpractice or maladministration to the awarding organisation and the awarding organisation’s procedures for taking action;
  * uses a Centre approval process which takes reasonable steps to ensure it only enters into an agreement with a Centre that has the capacity and capability to comply with its arrangements for all qualifications it will deliver. The approval process should include an assessment of the Centre’s: 
    * ability to comply with the awarding organisation’s requirements;
    * capability to deliver the qualification to the number of Learners it aims to register;
    * internal management controls;
  * maintains an up-to-date record of the Centres with which it has agreements and these agreements;
  * uses an agreement with a Centre which: 
    * requires the Centre to seek written approval from the awarding organisation before permitting a third party (for example training providers or satellite centres) to deliver any part of its qualifications, including its assessments;
    * places responsibility on the Centre to monitor whether any third party involved with the delivery and assessment of the qualification on its behalf has appropriate capacity and capability;
    * requires the Centre to agree in writing to its requirements before the awarding organisation approves the use of a third party;
  * before agreeing to a Centre’s request that a third party should be involved with the delivery of any part of a qualification, assures itself that the involvement of the third party will not put at risk the Centre’s ability to comply with the agreement or the awarding organisation’s ability to comply with its Conditions of Recognition;
  * monitors Centres’ adherence to the agreements to identify Centres that are not compliant, or that are at risk of failing to comply, including through routine and unannounced visits to Centres;
  * does not approve a Centre that it cannot effectively monitor, for example because of its location;
  * ensures that Centres only register Learners for qualifications whom they reasonably expect to complete the qualification and that they have the resources, capability and capacity to deliver the qualification to the expected number of Learners;
  * provides information to Centres to enable them to take appropriate steps to identify and notify the awarding organisations of any disabled Learners for whom the awarding organisation may need to make a Reasonable Adjustment, in time for such adjustment to be made;
  * collects and analyses appropriate data and information from Centres which helps inform its view of the risk that the Centre will not comply with its requirements;
  * identifies and addresses potential or actual Centre non-compliances in a timely way;
  * investigates Centres which it believes might not be, or are not, complying with its Centre agreement;
  * where it identifies Centres which are not acting in accordance with the agreement, takes appropriate action to secure compliance, or where necessary, applies appropriate and proportionate sanctions;
  * has a credible and effective approach to the use of sanctions that encourage compliance;
  * notifies other awarding organisations and relevant agencies with a role in protecting the interests of Learners where there are issues with the actions of Centres (subject to any requirements relating to the protection of such data);
  * maintains records of interactions with Centres, including, for example, those relating to inspections or malpractice investigations and monitors and manages the risks presented by these Centres;
  * identifies risks to Learners arising from Centre closures or withdrawals and puts in place effective arrangements to manage risks to Learners, including arrangements to allow Learners to complete assessments, in line with the Centre’s contingency plans;
  * seeks feedback and keeps its arrangements with its Centres under review, using feedback to improve its procedures and ensuring that these do not impose unnecessary burdens on Centres.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * enters into agreements with Centres which do not have the capability, capacity or resources to act in accordance with its agreement;
  * does not have written agreements with its Centres, or has agreements between the Centre and the awarding organisation which do not include all the provisions listed under C2.3;
  * does not monitor Centres’ compliance with the agreement in a way which would enable it to identify and take action to correct or mitigate any issues;
  * does not take responsibility for the way in which assessments are delivered by Centres, including the marking and Moderation of assessments;
  * does not enforce the agreement or impose appropriate sanctions when a Centre has breached the agreement;
  * has, and takes no action against, any Centres which: 
    * are not aware of their responsibilities under this agreement;
    * do not meet the requirements set by the awarding organisation and deliver qualifications in a way that is contrary to their agreement;
    * register Learners for the qualification where the Centre does not have the capacity, capability or resources to deliver the qualification to these Learners;
    * do not enable the awarding organisation to comply with the requirements of the General Conditions, for example by misrepresenting or mis-selling qualifications;
    * have not properly dealt with complaints or appeals from Learners;
  * does not have suitable arrangements in place to ensure that Learners are not unfairly disadvantaged if a Centre withdraws from its role in delivering the qualification.

#### Resilience arrangements

In accordance with Condition C2.6, in respect of GCSE, GCE, advanced extension
award and project qualifications that an awarding organisation makes
available, an awarding organisation must draw the attention of its Centres to
Ofqual’s guidance on gathering evidence of Learner performance for Learners
entering GCSEs, AS and A levels, the advanced extension award and project
qualifications.

In respect of other qualifications, an awarding organisation must consider
whether it is appropriate for a Centre to gather evidence during the academic
year of the level of attainment of each Learner so as to support resilience in
awarding that qualification should normal assessments for it be disrupted.
Where it does consider such evidence gathering to be appropriate, it must
provide guidance to the Centre in relation to that evidence. This could
include the nature of the evidence, when it is gathered etc. Evidence
gathering by a Centre is likely to be appropriate where:

  * other suitable evidence on which to base a grade is unlikely to be available because of the approach taken to assessment (for example, where the qualification does not normally include non-exam assessment, or it follows an academic year cycle (over 1 or 2 years) and there are limited assessment opportunities)
  * a Learner needs to rely on the qualification for immediate progression; and
  * the qualification does not attest to the achievement of occupational or professional competence, provide a licence to practise, or similar

Where an awarding organisation offers other qualifications that have a similar
assessment structure and are used in similar ways to GCSE, GCE, advanced
extension award and project qualifications, it should have regard to the
approach that is being taken for such general qualifications to ensure that
its Learners are not unduly advantaged or disadvantaged in comparison to
Learners taking those general qualifications.

When producing guidance for its Centres, an awarding organisation may wish to
replicate, in whole or part, the [guidance for Centres offering general
qualifications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-
collecting-evidence-of-student-performance-to-ensure-resilience-in-the-
qualifications-system). When doing so, an awarding organisation will need to
tailor that guidance in order to ensure that it is relevant to its own
qualification, including considering if anything additional needs to be
included in the guidance to reflect factors specific to its qualification.

Wherever possible, when producing guidance for its Centres, an awarding
organisation should also seek to:

  * minimise the level of burden for Centres, Teachers, and Learners
  * enable Teachers to gather evidence in line with their existing assessment processes
  * take into account the need for any evidence gathered by Centres to sufficiently demonstrate the level of attainment of each Learner, and
  * align its guidance with that of other awarding organisations offering similar qualifications.

## Condition C3 Arrangements with publishers

  1. C3.1 Where an awarding organisation has in place an endorsement process, the awarding organisation must: 
    1. (a) take all reasonable steps to ensure that the endorsement process does not have an Adverse Effect, and
    2. (b) publish the criteria which it uses to decide whether or not to endorse a particular resource.

  1. C3.2 For the purposes of this condition, an ‘endorsement process’ is a process by which the awarding organisation endorses resources which are designed to support the preparation of Learners and persons likely to become Learners for assessments for a qualification which it makes available or proposes to make available.

### Guidance on Condition C3

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * considers the Adverse Effects that endorsement of resources could have when developing the criteria which it uses to decide whether or not to endorse a particular resource, and seeks to prevent or mitigate those Adverse Effects through those criteria;
  * gives clear guidelines to relevant staff and contractors on engagement with publishers seeking endorsement of their resources;
  * takes all reasonable steps to ensure that its endorsement is signalled in the same way for all endorsed resources (through, for example, the use of its logo or text expressing the endorsement), including those produced by the awarding organisation itself or an affiliate company;
  * takes all reasonable steps to ensure that publishers of endorsed resources do not market an endorsed resource in a way which implies that the resource contains privileged examiner insight or that its use is necessary for the successful completion of an assessment or qualification.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * does not consider the possible Adverse Effects that endorsement of resources could have when developing the criteria which it uses to decide whether or not to endorse a particular resource, or does not seek to prevent or mitigate those Adverse Effects through those criteria;
  * does not give clear guidelines to relevant staff and contractors on engagement with publishers seeking endorsement of their resources;

#  Section D - General requirements for regulated qualifications

General rules, including about qualification fitness for purpose and
accessibility, and about reviewing approach, enquiries and complaints,
withdrawing qualifications and information for teachers.

## Condition D1 - Fitness for purpose of qualifications

D1.1 An awarding organisation must ensure that each qualification which it
makes available is fit for purpose.

  1. D1.2 A qualification will only be fit for purpose if that qualification, as far as possible, secures the requirements of – 
    1. (a) Validity,
    2. (b) Reliability,
    3. (c) Comparability,
    4. (d) Manageability, and
    5. (e) Minimising Bias.

  1. D1.3 In any case where there is a conflict between two or more of the requirements in Condition D1.2, an awarding organisation must secure that it achieves a balance between those requirements that – 
    1. (a) ensures its compliance with its Conditions of Recognition, and
    2. (b) is objectively the optimum balance in relation to the particular qualification.

There is currently no guidance on complying with these Conditions

## Condition D2 - Accessibility of qualifications

  1. D2.1 An awarding organisation must ensure that it complies with the requirements of Equalities Law in relation to each of the qualifications which it makes available.

  1. D2.2 An awarding organisation must monitor qualifications which it makes available for any feature which could disadvantage a group of Learners who share a particular Characteristic.

  1. D2.3 Where an awarding organisation has identified such a feature, it must – 
    1. (a) remove any disadvantage which is unjustifiable, and
    2. (b) maintain a record of any disadvantage which it believes to be justifiable, setting out the reasons why in its opinion the disadvantage is justifiable.

### Guidance on Condition D2

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * has an up-to-date understanding of Equalities Law relevant to qualification design, delivery and award;
  * takes into account, when designing a qualification, information and advice on how different groups might be affected by particular features;
  * collects and analyses evidence to identify any features of its qualifications that have disadvantaged, or could disadvantage, a group of Learners who share a particular Characteristic, for example from Learner surveys, focus groups, statistical analysis, monitoring of Learner profiles and/or specialist reviews;
  * removes, where possible, or minimises features of its qualifications or assessments that have disadvantaged or might disadvantage a group of Learners sharing a particular Characteristic.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * breaches Equalities Law;
  * does not deal proportionately and appropriately with concerns from Learners or other stakeholders about possible bias in its qualifications;
  * does not actively monitor whether any features of its qualifications disadvantage particular Learners, or take appropriate steps to remove or reduce any such disadvantage.

## Condition D3 - Reviewing approach

### Review of approach

  1. D3.1 An awarding organisation must keep under review, and must enhance where necessary, its approach to the development, delivery and award of qualifications, so as to assure itself that its approach remains at all times appropriate.

### Evidence to inform approach

  1. D3.2 An awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) have due regard to all information, comments and complaints received from Users of qualifications in relation to the development, delivery and award of qualifications, and
    2. (b) identify and give due regard to any credible evidence which suggests that a change in its approach to the development, delivery and award of qualifications is required in order to ensure that the approach remains appropriate.

  1. D3.3 Where an event relating to an awarding organisation (or an event, of which it is or should be aware, relating to any other awarding organisation) has had an Adverse Effect, the awarding organisation must review and revise where necessary its approach to the development, delivery and award of qualifications to ensure that its approach remains appropriate.

### Guidance on Condition D3

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * reviews its approach to developing, delivering and awarding its qualifications in a regular and systematic manner, for example by refreshing its approaches in light of experience and feedback and undertaking in-depth periodic reviews;
  * changes its approach to developing, delivering and awarding qualifications where it has identified a need, for example because: 
    * it finds a systemic problem with its approaches through monitoring, its investigation into an event that has or may result in an Adverse Effect or through complaints it has received;
    * it has submitted qualifications for accreditation which were found not to comply with the accreditation criteria;
    * it has received information about an Adverse Effect (for example from another awarding organisation) that could potentially have an impact on the way it develops, delivers or awards its own qualifications;
    * it has received feedback from the regulator through audits, research or other means;
  * reviews each of its qualifications in a regular and systemic way, for example by annual monitoring of the performance of a qualification and more in-depth reviews every three to five years;
  * during its review of a qualification includes an independent element to ensure objectivity and challenge. This could be, for example, through one or more of: 
    * employers from the sector the qualification is designed for;
    * organisations that rely on the qualification, for example further or higher education institutions;
    * other external stakeholders including Centres;
    * internal staff who were not involved in originally developing, delivering or awarding the qualification;
  * during its review of the development, delivery and award of a qualification takes into account and acts, as necessary, on any feedback received from Ofqual (for example, decisions from a previous accreditation submission, or outcomes of relevant audits);
  * seeks, records and analyses feedback from Users of qualifications (including, for example, employers and professional bodies who have an interest in the qualification and who may generate evidence about whether or not a qualification is meeting its objective) and takes it into account during its review of a qualification;
  * evaluates, records and, where appropriate, implements any improvements to its approach to developing, delivering and awarding a qualification in a timely and effective way. The awarding organisation ensures that, as far as possible, Learners are not unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged as a result of the way in which it implements any changes;
  * takes all reasonable steps, following the occurrence of an Adverse Effect, to revise its approach to the development, delivery and award of qualifications so as to reduce the likelihood of the Adverse Effect reoccurring in respect of any of its qualifications.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * does not routinely review its approach to developing, delivering or awarding a qualification;
  * does not consider whether it should review its approach in light of information of Adverse Effects affecting another awarding organisation of which it should be aware;
  * does not seek or respond, where appropriate, to feedback from Users of qualifications;
  * does not consider and act on information received from Users of qualifications or from Ofqual that identifies potential or actual issues with its approach to developing, delivering or awarding a qualification;
  * does not, without good reason, make necessary changes to a qualification that its review of that qualification has highlighted as necessary;
  * changes its approach to developing, delivering or awarding a qualification in a way that has, or may have, an adverse impact on Learners, unless it has good reason for doing so;
  * fails to consider, when dealing with an issue that arises in respect of one of its qualifications, whether the issue may affect other qualifications too.

## Condition D4 - Responding to enquiries and complaints procedures

### Responding to enquiries from Users of qualifications

  1. D4.1 An awarding organisation must answer accurately, fully and within a reasonable time any reasonable enquiries received by it from Users of qualifications.

  1. D4.2 Nothing in this condition obliges an awarding organisation to disclose information if to do so would breach a duty of confidentiality or any other legal duty.

### Complaints procedures

  1. D4.3 An awarding organisation must establish, maintain, publish and at all times comply with a written complaints procedure.

  1. D4.4 The complaints procedure must in particular include procedures and timescales for – 
    1. (a) responding to complaints, and
    2. (b) dealing with the subject matter of complaints.

There is currently no guidance on complying with these Conditions

## Condition D5 - Compliance of qualifications with Regulatory Documents

  1. D5.1 An awarding organisation must ensure that in the development, delivery and award of any qualification which it makes available, or proposes to make available, it – 
    1. (a) complies with any requirement relating to that qualification which is set out in a Regulatory Document, and
    2. (b) has regard to any guidelines and principles of good practice relating to that qualification which are set out in a Regulatory Document.

There is currently no guidance on complying with these Conditions

## Condition D6 - Management of the withdrawal of qualifications

  1. D6.1 For the purposes of this condition, an awarding organisation withdraws a qualification at the point in time when it first – 
    1. (a) ceases to register Learners for the qualification,
    2. (b) ceases to deliver or award that qualification to Learners,
    3. (c) surrenders its recognition in respect of that qualification, or
    4. (d) has its recognition withdrawn by Ofqual in respect of that qualification.

  1. D6.2 Where an awarding organisation intends to withdraw, otherwise believes it to be likely that it will withdraw, or is obliged to withdraw, a qualification, it must take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of Learners in relation to that qualification.

  1. D6.3 An awarding organisation must give to Ofqual reasonable notice of its anticipated withdrawal of a qualification, and must do so prior to the time at which it provides that information to any Learners, Centres, or purchasers of qualifications.

  1. D6.4 Where an awarding organisation intends to withdraw, or is obliged to withdraw, a qualification, it must – 
    1. (a) promptly prepare, maintain, and comply with a written withdrawal plan, which must specify how the interests of Learners in relation to that qualification will be protected, and
    2. (b) provide clear and accurate information about the withdrawal to Learners, Centres, and purchasers of qualifications who are likely to be affected by the withdrawal.

  1. D6.5 An awarding organisation must ensure that any withdrawal plan which it prepares complies with any requirements which Ofqual has communicated to it in writing.

### Guidance on Condition D6

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

In respect of the withdrawal of qualifications, the awarding organisation:

  * regularly monitors the extent to which its qualifications are taken by Learners (such as reviewing registration and certification data). After analysing this information or the outcome of any other review(s) of its qualifications, the awarding organisation puts in place steps to withdraw any qualifications: 
    * for which it is not currently making awards, or for which it has never made an award and which it is unlikely to award in the near future; or
    * that are no longer fit for purpose; or
    * that no longer meet its regulatory requirements; or
    * that it has replaced with an alternative qualification;
  * gives notice to Ofqual of its intention to withdraw a qualification within a reasonable timeframe and before it communicates this to Learners, Centres and purchasers of the qualification;
  * promptly sets an operational end-date and certificate end-date when it decides to withdraw a qualification and provides this information to Centres and other relevant Users (taking into account the uptake and purpose of the qualification);
  * includes in its withdrawal plan: 
    * clear timescales;
    * an explanation of why the qualification is being withdrawn;
    * information about the numbers of Learners or Centres that may be affected;
    * information about how the interests of Learners taking the qualification will be protected;
  * delivers the withdrawal plan effectively, keeps the plan under review (including seeking and analysing feedback from Centres about how the withdrawal is progressing) and changes the plan, as necessary;
  * provides relevant and timely information to Users about the qualification being withdrawn. This information is proportionate to the impact of the withdrawal, and could include (where applicable): 
    * which qualifications are being withdrawn and why;
    * how the withdrawal could affect Learners;
    * dates for final registrations for new Learners, and assessments and retake opportunities for existing Learners;
    * information about deadlines for completing particular actions;
    * arrangements for Learners to switch to alternative qualifications, if appropriate;
  * taking into account the uptake and purpose of the qualification, provides timely and relevant information to Learners, Centres and purchasers of qualifications about alternative or replacement qualifications that are available and how these differ from the qualification being withdrawn;
  * where a qualification is withdrawn as a regulated qualification but continues to be available as an unregulated one, communicates the changed nature of its regulatory status to avoid Users of qualifications being confused or misled and ensure it complies with the requirements of Condition B5.1.

In addition to the guidance above, in relation to withdrawal or surrender of
recognition which will lead to the withdrawal of qualifications (General
Conditions D6.1(c) and (d)), compliance will be indicated where the awarding
organisation:

  * approaches Ofqual at an early stage to discuss its action plan relating to the surrender of its recognition;
  * uses staff who have the necessary capability to manage the withdrawal or surrender of its recognition and the associated withdrawal of the qualifications.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * does not act upon a requirement to withdraw one or more of its qualifications following a decision by Ofqual to withdraw its recognition in respect of those qualifications;
  * does not give appropriate notice to Users of qualifications of its plan to withdraw a qualification to allow them time to make suitable plans ahead of the withdrawal;
  * does not provide sufficient information for affected Users when it withdraws a qualification, for example about timelines or possible alternative available qualifications;
  * does not provide sufficient resources to deliver, mark or award a qualification that is being withdrawn;
  * allows a Learner to enrol or register for a qualification that they are unlikely to be able to complete before the qualification is withdrawn;
  * does not make clear what arrangements (if any) are in place for Learners to retake assessments for a qualification that is being withdrawn;
  * continues to offer the withdrawn qualification and certificates it as a ‘regulated qualification’;
  * promotes or allows others to promote any qualification which it has withdrawn from the Register as a regulated qualification.

## Condition D7 - Making available information to help meet Teachers’ needs

  1. D7.1 In respect of each qualification which it makes available, an awarding organisation must ensure that there is available to each Teacher any information which, for the purpose of preparing Learners and persons likely to become Learners for assessments for that qualification, the Teacher may reasonably require to be provided by the awarding organisation.

There is currently no guidance on complying with this Condition

## Condition D8 - Compliance with saving and transitional provisions following
cessation of accreditation

  1. D8.1 In respect of each qualification which it makes available that is subject to an accreditation requirement in accordance with section 139 of the Act, and for which accreditation will cease to have effect in accordance with section 140(6) of the Act, an awarding organisation must comply with any requirements relating to that qualification which are set out in any saving and transitional provisions made by Ofqual in accordance with section 140(10) of the Act.

There is currently no guidance on complying with this Condition

## Guidance for designing and developing accessible assessments

This guidance is for awarding organisations when they are designing and
developing assessments – particularly, though not exclusively, exams or other
written assessments. The guidance concerns the accessibility of assessments
for students, referred to hereafter as Learners.

This guidance will help awarding organisations to comply with the following
General Conditions:

  * Condition C1 – Arrangements with third parties
  * Condition D1 – Fitness for purpose of qualifications
  * Condition D2 – Accessibility of qualifications
  * Condition E4 – Ensuring an assessment is fit for purpose and can be delivered
  * Condition G1 – Setting the assessment
  * Condition G3 – Use of language and Stimulus Materials
  * Condition G6 – Arrangements for Reasonable Adjustments
  * Condition G9 – Delivering the assessment

This guidance should also help awarding organisations comply with their
obligations under Equalities Law, a requirement of Condition D2.

Assessments should enable Learners fully to demonstrate the knowledge, skills
and understanding that the assessment is intended to measure (the assessment
construct). An accessible assessment will not include any irrelevant features
that make it more difficult, or more easy, for some Learners than others to
demonstrate what they know, understand and can do to the required standard.

Assessments should not be easier or more difficult for certain Learners just
because of their protected characteristics, for example because of their
gender or ethnicity. They should not stereotype or use language which is
likely to cause offence.

Designing and developing assessments that are accessible for the widest range
of Learners is not always straightforward. This guidance should help awarding
organisations balance the various factors they need to consider. It should
help them to recognise and avoid irrelevant features in assessments that could
unfairly disadvantage certain Learners.

### Guidance

####  Validity – the overarching principle

**Principle** : An assessment task should only measure what it is intended to
measure.

The purpose of an assessment task is to enable a Learner to demonstrate their
level of attainment in relation to specific elements of knowledge, skills and
understanding. To enable this, the task should only test those elements of
knowledge, skills and understanding that it is intended to measure. If a task
is intended to measure basic numerical skills, the task should not require
Learners to also negotiate complex language (for example, in the wording of
the question). However, if the task intends to measure Learners’ understanding
of complex language, then complex language should be the central element of
the task.

#### Assessment structure

**Principle** : The structure of the assessment should not create unnecessary
barriers for particular Learners.

Awarding organisations should consider the impact on Learners of the order of
tasks and avoid placing more demanding tasks at the start of an assessment. If
an assessment differentiates performance by using tasks of different levels of
demand, placing more demanding questions early in the assessment might
demotivate some Learners. It might also prevent them from fully demonstrating
the required knowledge, skills and understanding in the remainder of the
assessment.

#### Assessment instructions

**Principle** : Instructions on how to complete an assessment should be clear
and unambiguous.

The instructions in an assessment should:

  * enable Learners to understand how to complete the assessment without needing to read through unnecessary text
  * clearly tell Learners what they need to do – for example, how many tasks they must complete, whether their answers should make a certain number of points or be within a word limit, or to turn the page to find further information relating to the task
  * make it clear whether Learners can respond in different ways for example, by using either a bar chart or a pie chart
  * give instructions in the order in which Learners should follow them. Each instruction might be in a separate sentence or paragraph
  * be in the active voice and give direct instructions. For example, “You have 2 hours” or “you have 2 hours plus any extra time allowance” to complete the assessment”, “Answer all the questions”
  * if referring to any other elements of the assessment (for example, to an image or to source text), be clear to which element the instructions are referring
  * use commands that are literal, unambiguous and explicit, so Learners do not interpret commands in different ways
  * only include information for Learners and not, for example, information for invigilators

The instructions in an assessment should not:

  * require Learners to hold large amounts of information in their working memory, unless the assessment construct requires otherwise

#### Language

**Principle** : The language used in an assessment task should be appropriate
for the assessment level and construct, and should not create unnecessary
barriers to Learners.

General Condition G3 requires the language used in assessments to be
“appropriate”, taking into account the age of the Learners likely to take the
assessment, the level and objective of the qualification, and the knowledge,
skills and understanding being assessed. Language should reflect the
assessment construct and/ or the level of the qualification. That will mean
language used in some assessments is necessarily more complex than in others.

In some assessments, understanding complex language is one of the things being
assessed and will therefore be used in the assessment tasks. Awarding
organisations should otherwise avoid using complex language.

**Unless the assessment construct, level, context or subject requires
otherwise** , an awarding organisation should aim to:

  * use language that is straightforward – for example, “with” rather than “in conjunction with”
  * use words that are commonly understood – for example, “appropriate” rather than “apt” or “use” rather than “utilise”
  * use words and phrases consistently – for example, refer to “text” or “source” but do not use both interchangeably
  * use command words that are appropriate to the expectations of the task, and use these consistently and correctly
  * only use names where necessary – the inclusion of a name could confuse some Learners – especially if the name is unfamiliar or if it is used at the start of a sentence
  * be cautious when using negative words (such as “not” or “don’t”), as some Learners might overlook them
  * use active verbs where appropriate – a subject-verb-object construction can help Learners understand the action the sentence describes
  * consider the most appropriate way to present abbreviated phrases, including whether to give the expanded form of abbreviations only the first time they are used. For example, “International Monetary Fund” for “IMF”
  * make sure questions are worded clearly – for example, consider whether asking the question “Explain how…” or “Summarise how…”, rather than simply “How…”, would make the question clearer
  * consider the reading age of Learners who would typically take the assessment

**Unless the assessment construct requires otherwise** , an awarding
organisation should avoid:

  * uncommon words with unusual or irregular spelling
  * words that are specific to a region, country, or particular culture or socioeconomic background, that may not be familiar to some Learners taking the assessment
  * words that have more than one meaning. For example, “present”, “sound”
  * ambiguous use of pronouns. For example, some Learners might not understand what “it” refers to in the following: “the hotel room featured a large bed, a lampshade and a desk. It was three feet high.”
  * abstract nouns – for example, “state what you think about this event” is better than “state what your reflections are about this event”
  * more than one negative in a sentence
  * unnecessary figurative language, including colloquialisms, idioms and metaphors

#### Sentence structures

**Principle** : Sentences in assessment tasks should be structured clearly.

**Unless the assessment construct requires otherwise** , an awarding
organisation should:

  * use just one clause or idea per sentence, with each task expressed in a separate sentence or question
  * use clear punctuation
  * put any background information to the task or question in a separate sentence or paragraph
  * give any relevant information about the time or setting of the task at the beginning of the sentence
  * arrange sentences that describe sequential actions in the appropriate logical or chronological order
  * where sentences do not describe sequential actions, consider giving the most important sentence first

**Unless the assessment construct requires otherwise** , an awarding
organisation should avoid:

  * participle clauses (clauses which do not explicitly indicate tense or who is doing the action of the verb). For example, the following sentence may be challenging for some Learners: “Calculate the ratio of the sides of Rectangle A to the corresponding sides of Rectangle B, giving your answer in the form of 1: n.” The task could instead be written in two sentences: “Calculate the ratio of the sides of Rectangle A to the corresponding sides of Rectangle B. Give your answer in the form 1: n.”

#### Source text or materials, context, images and colour

Where an awarding organisation is considering including source material,
context, images or colour in an assessment task, the awarding organisation
should consider whether it would be central, useful or incidental to the
construct.

  * A **central element** is necessary to measure the construct. An awarding organisation should include central elements in the assessment, even where they might be challenging for some Learners. For example, if the assessment is measuring a Learner’s ability to understand legal or historical text, the assessment must include such text
  * A **useful element** might help to measure the construct but is not strictly necessary. An awarding organisation should consider whether any elements might be useful for some Learners (for example, an image that would help some Learners understand the written task) could be distracting for others who might have difficulty seeing it or who might wrongly assume there is additional information in the image that they need to use to complete the task. Consider how to achieve an appropriate balance across the assessment
  * An **incidental element** does not help to measure the target construct – for example, an image that is purely decorative. An awarding organisation should avoid incidental elements that might look attractive but add nothing to the assessment task, as they can be distracting or confusing for Learners

#### Source text or materials

**Principle** : Source text or materials should only be provided in an
assessment where they support the measurement of the assessment construct.

Where an awarding organisation adds source text or materials to a task, the
text or materials should:

  * use language that is of appropriate complexity for the assessment construct. For example, source text should only include colloquialisms, idioms and metaphors when these are part of the construct
  * be presented in a format that is likely to be familiar to Learners (unless the interpretation of unfamiliar formats is part of the construct)
  * have line numbers, paragraph numbers or section headings if appropriate
  * be of an appropriate length to measure the construct, and include an explanation of how the materials should be used in the task

When adding source text or materials to a task, an awarding organisation
should try to ensure no group of Learners is advantaged or disadvantaged. An
example of this would be use of a source text that is more familiar or
accessible to Learners from a particular socioeconomic background where that
is not relevant to the assessment construct.

When adding source text or materials to a task an awarding organisation should
avoid using:

  * unnecessary negative, narrow or stereotypical representations of particular groups
  * source text or materials that might be interpreted differently by Learners where such interpretation does not form part of the construct

#### Context

**Principle** : Tasks should only be set in a context where that supports the
measurement of the assessment construct.

**Unless the assessment construct requires otherwise** , an awarding
organisation should:

  * be sensitive to contexts that will not be equally familiar to all Learners, and try to ensure no particular group of Learners is advantaged or disadvantaged by the choice of context. For example, blind or deaf Learners might find it more difficult to perform well in the task if their disability means the context in which the task is set will be unfamiliar to them. Contexts such as those related to particular types of housing, family arrangements, or social, travel or cultural experiences may advantage or disadvantage particular groups of Learners
  * be sensitive to the possibility that the context might confuse or distract some Learners, for example, Learners on the autism spectrum, or Learners whose first language is not English. Such Learners might assume that their lack of familiarity with a context will prevent them from attempting the task, or might be distracted by the context to an extent that they do not demonstrate the full extent of their knowledge, skills and understanding’

**Unless the assessment construct requires otherwise** , an awarding
organisation should not:

  * use a context that will confuse or distract Learners from the task – for example, because it could be contentious or upsetting
  * use unnecessary negative, narrow or stereotypical representations of particular groups

#### Images

**Principle** : Images should only be used in an assessment where they support
the measurement of the assessment construct. Where images are used, they
should be clear.

Images can help some Learners to access the task – including those who have
difficulty reading or those less familiar with the context in which a task is
set. However, images can be a barrier to others, including some Learners on
the autism spectrum, Learners with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) who might find them distracting, and Learners with a visual impairment.
Where images are used in an assessment, awarding organisations should consider
the need also to describe the image.

An awarding organisation should consider whether an image is central, useful
or incidental to measuring the construct, and balance the interests of
different Learners when deciding whether to use an image. If an image supports
or emphasises the ideas in the text, the image might be a useful element of
the task. Awarding organisations should consider how useful the image would be
for the Learners overall, and whether its usefulness would outweigh any
problems it might cause for particular Learners.

**Unless the assessment construct requires otherwise** , awarding
organisations should:

  * use clear images. For example, a clear diagram or line drawing might be more accessible than a photograph or a 3D-effect drawing
  * use images with clearly defined and distinguishable features, labels and symbols that do not include irrelevant information. For example, a graph might only include major grid lines; a data table might only include the data needed to test the construct
  * use images that are large enough to allow the key features to be easily distinguished
  * use straight lines or arrows where they are needed to join labels to an image. Ideally, lines or arrows should not intersect with other label lines or arrows, and it should be clear to which part of the image each label refers
  * make the relationship between an image and its associated task clear. For example, by using a heading at the top of the image to indicate clearly what it is, to which task it relates and any other essential information (such as that the image is not drawn to scale)
  * consider whether the image could be made accessible to Learners with a visual impairment before deciding whether to use it
  * decide whether an image that is useful but not central to the task would be similarly useful in a paper modified for braille users, for those who require tactile images or for those using digital technology
  * consider whether to, in response to a request for a Reasonable Adjustment for a Learner with a disability who finds images distracting, provide a modified paper that omits useful (although not central) images
  * consider the potential cumulative effect of the images used across an assessment, as well as the images used on a task-by-task basis

#### Colours

**Principle** : Assessment tasks should only require Learners to distinguish
between colours where this is central to the measurement of the assessment
construct.

**Unless the assessment construct requires otherwise** (for example, because a
competence standard requires a Learner to differentiate between the colours of
electrical wires), awarding organisations should:

  * consider using patterns, shading, hatching or text labels to distinguish between sections of an image
  * consider shading an area to indicate a blank space, rather than using only an outline
  * where colour is used, ensure there is sufficient contrast between any text and its background, in line with the colour contrast ratios specified by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines on Contrast (Minimum)
  * where colours are used to convey information, ensure they contrast sufficiently with adjacent colours, in line with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines on Non-text Contrast

**Unless the assessment construct requires otherwise** , awarding
organisations should not:

  * overuse hatching within an image where this could make the image confusing for Learners
  * use coloured backgrounds (although some Learners may choose to modify their assessment material to have a coloured background, for example as a Reasonable Adjustment)
  * require Learners to infer information through the use of colour alone

#### Layout

**Principle** : The layout of an assessment should be clear and consistent and
not create an unnecessary barrier for Learners.

**Unless the assessment construct requires otherwise** , awarding
organisations should:

  * consider using white space between blocks of text and images
  * ensure that the font and text size are easily readable, including when text is used within or alongside an image
  * consider using shorter paragraphs, section headings, subheadings or lists to break up long sections of text
  * ensure that, where possible, Learners can readily access all relevant information for a particular task. For example, putting it all on the same page or double-spread of pages, rather than having to turn between different pages in paper-based assessments or to avoid scrolling up and down long pages or between pages in on-screen assessments
  * align text with the left margin, but not with the right margin (That is, text should be “ragged right” not “justified”)
  * indicate to Learners where a page has been left intentionally blank – for example, with text that states “[BLANK PAGE]”
  * be mindful of the range of formats in which Learners will be taking the assessment, such as modified large print and onscreen. For example, number questions and sub-questions clearly for Learners using assistive technology, as use of numbers, letters and roman numerals together, such as ‘1(a). i’, can lead to translation errors in ‘text to speech’ software

The [UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF) produces standards and
guidance for accessible documents](https://www.ukaaf.org/), including minimum
standards and guidance for clear print, large print and braille documents.

#### Anticipating Reasonable Adjustments

An awarding organisation must make Reasonable Adjustments for disabled
Learners, to meet their duties under Equalities Law. Ofqual’s General
Condition E4.2(d) requires awarding organisations to ensure an assessment
“permits Reasonable Adjustments to be made, while minimising the need for
them”.

When designing and developing an assessment, an awarding organisation should
anticipate the diversity of the Learners likely to take it, and the range of
Reasonable Adjustments disabled Learners might need. For example, some
Learners might need a reader, a British Sign Language interpretation, a
braille version of the assessment, or versions that are compatible with
assistive software. An assessment designed to be taken in one format should be
available for disabled Learners in other formats too, unless the assessment
construct precludes it.

Awarding organisations should consider whether a Reasonable Adjustment might
raise accessibility issues for a particular task. For example, awarding
organisations should consider how images would be provided in alternative
formats, or how screen-reading software would “read” a table of data.

If a task would be inaccessible when used with certain types of Reasonable
Adjustment, the awarding organisation should decide how the task would be
changed or replaced to make it accessible when used with those Reasonable
Adjustments, or whether another form of Reasonable Adjustment could be used
instead.

An awarding organisation should be cautious of wording that would not be
relevant in alternative formats. For example, “See picture opposite” will not
be relevant for Learners using a braille paper and might not be applicable for
modifications with different layouts, such as large print or those using
assistive software. If such wording is used in the standard paper, it should
be removed or adjusted in modified papers as appropriate.

#### Alternative formats and assistive technology

An awarding organisation should have regard to this guidance when putting
assessments into an alternative format for a Reasonable Adjustment – whether
the modification is undertaken in-house or by a third party.

An awarding organisation should consider how Learners who use digital and/or
assistive technology as a Reasonable Adjustment will be able to access the
assessment. For instance, Learners might use a digital version of the paper to
alter the colour of the background or magnify the content. A Learner might use
a computer/screen reader to listen to their responses. A Learner might rely on
text descriptors (“alt text”) to access images.

An awarding organisation should consider whether disabled Learners using
digital and/or assistive technology would have to do more work than Learners
using the standard format. For example, Learners who need to switch between
separate files in a software program to see source material and tasks could be
disadvantaged compared to Learners who see all the material together in paper
versions. Learners who do not use an answer booklet could be disadvantaged
compared to Learners who could judge the expected length of response as it is
indicated by the space provided in the answer booklet.

With digital assessment materials, whether in a digital document format or
dedicated platform, an awarding organisation should be aware of the [Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines’ accessibility principles “perceivable,
operable, understandable and
robust”](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-
four-principles-of-accessibility). This will help ensure that Learners using
digital and/or assistive technology can use digital assessment materials
reliably. This can be achieved in part through meeting the European standard
on the accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT
products and services in Europe EN 301 549, which is currently aligned to the
[W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Level
AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/). Awarding organisations
should use appropriately validated lists of the assistive technology disabled
Learners taking the assessment might use. They should check whether the
assistive technology will work with their assessments. Awarding organisations
might also find it helpful to consider the [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
(WAI) supplemental guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/) to
the Web Content Accessibility Guidance (WCAG 2). Although this guidance is not
specifically about assessments, it contains advice on using clear and
understandable page structure and content, including use of white spacing.

#### An awarding organisation’s processes

An awarding organisation should ensure all those involved in the design and
development of assessments understand the importance of accessibility and
inclusion, and of how to design and develop accessible assessments.

An awarding organisation should ensure those designing and developing
assessments consider the diversity of Learners likely to take the assessment.
It might consult Learners or groups that work with or represent Learners or
individuals with relevant expertise. In particular it might consult groups
that represent Learners who share a protected characteristic, or that
represent disadvantaged Learners.

[Condition D2.2](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-d-
general-requirements-for-regulated-qualifications) requires an awarding
organisation to monitor qualifications which it makes available for any
feature which would disadvantage a group of Learners who share a particular
Characteristic. An awarding organisation should review whether any specific
tasks or formats, or types of task or format, would advantage or disadvantage
particular Learners.

In accordance with [Condition D3.2](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-
handbook/section-d-general-requirements-for-regulated-qualifications), an
awarding organisation should also gather and respond to stakeholder feedback
on the accessibility of its assessments. An awarding organisation should:

  * seek feedback from Centres, gather and analyse information (for example about complaints received and the performance of Learners), to identify issues with its use of language or Stimulus Materials
  * use feedback to inform its development of valid assessments and qualifications and to provide feedback and training for those who develop assessment materials

  *[Validity]: Validity: The extent to which evidence and theory support the interpretation that the assessment outcomes meet their intended uses. The evaluation of Validity involves the development of a clear argument to support the proposed interpretation of the outcomes and as a consequence the intended uses of the assessment. The Validity argument should be built on statements of the proposed interpretation and supporting evidence collected from all stages of the assessment process.
  *[Reliability]: Reliability is about consistency and so concerns the extent to which the various stages in the assessment process generate outcomes which would be replicated were the assessment repeated. Reliability is a necessary condition of Validity, as it is not possible to demonstrate the Validity of an assessment process which is not Reliable. The Reliability of an assessment is affected by a range of factors such as the sampling of assessment tasks and inconsistency in marking by human Assessors.
  *[Comparability]: Comparability: Generating assessment outcomes that are comparable in standards between assessments within a qualification, between similar qualifications, with other awarding organisations, and over time. Where an assessment has equivalent forms then it is important to ensure comparability of outcomes. There are two reasons for this. First, to reach fair comparisons about the attainment of Learners: It is impossible to produce different forms with exactly the same content and statistical specifications (such as the level of difficulty or demand on the Learner). Therefore, a requirement to ensure comparability of outcomes makes sure the level of difficulty or demand of the test forms is taken into account when setting standards so that Learners taking the different forms can be compared fairly. Second, to ensure that the outcomes can be used as a measure of standards: outcomes from different forms of the same test must be comparable if they are to be used to measure standards over time. Both expert judgements and statistical procedures such as test equating can be used to ensure comparability of outcomes from different forms of the same test. It is, however, important to ensure that assessments are not so similar that they become predictable, as this would be a threat to Validity.
  *[Manageability]: Manageability relates to the feasibility of carrying out particular assessment processes. A Manageable assessment process is one which places reasonable demands on Centres and Learners. The evaluation of the reasonableness of the demands will be based on the scale of the assessment process on the participants, balanced by the usefulness of the outcomes. As with the other requirements (Validity, Reliability, Comparability and Minimising Bias), judgements about Manageability must be balanced with considerations around the other requirements.
  *[Minimising Bias]: Minimising Bias is about ensuring that an assessment does not produce unreasonably adverse outcomes for Learners who share a common attribute. The Minimisation of Bias is related to fairness to all Learners and is also closely related to statutory equality duties.
  *[Conditions of Recognition]: Conditions of Recognition: All conditions to which an awarding organisation’s recognition is subject (including other conditions imposed under section 132(3)(d) of the Act).
  *[Equalities Law]: Equalities Law: The Equality Act 2010, any Act that was a statutory predecessor to that Act, or any legislation in a jurisdiction other than England which has an equivalent purpose and effect.
  *[Learners]: Learner: A person who is registered to take a qualification and to be assessed as part of that qualification.
  *[Characteristic]: Characteristic: Age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation.
  *[Learner]: Learner: A person who is registered to take a qualification and to be assessed as part of that qualification.
  *[Users of qualifications]: Users of qualifications: Persons who have a legitimate interest in the qualification or type of qualification made available by the awarding organisation, which may include: Learners and Learners’ representatives; Centres; Teachers; employers and employers’ representatives; further and higher education establishments; schools; government departments and agencies; and professional bodies.
  *[Adverse Effect]: Adverse Effect: An act, omission, event, incident, or circumstance has an Adverse Effect if it gives rise to prejudice to Learners or potential Learners, or adversely affects: the ability of the awarding organisation to undertake the development, delivery or award of qualifications in accordance with its Conditions of Recognition; the standards of qualifications which the awarding organisation makes available or proposes to make available; or public confidence in qualifications.
  *[Centres]: An organisation undertaking the delivery of an assessment (and potentially other activities) to Learners on behalf of an awarding organisation. Centres are typically educational institutions, training providers, or employers.
  *[Regulatory Document]: Regulatory Document: A regulatory document, or part of a regulatory document, which features in a document entitled the ‘Regulatory Document List’, which may be published by Ofqual and may be varied and replaced by Ofqual from time to time.
  *[Users]: Users of qualifications: Persons who have a legitimate interest in the qualification or type of qualification made available by the awarding organisation, which may include: Learners and Learners’ representatives; Centres; Teachers; employers and employers’ representatives; further and higher education establishments; schools; government departments and agencies; and professional bodies.
  *[Register]: Register: The register published and maintained by Ofqual in accordance with section 148 of the Act.
  *[Teacher]: Teacher: A person who prepares any Learner, or any person likely to become a Learner, for assessment for a qualification and who does so as a lecturer, supervisor, tutor or other appropriate provider of education or training, or in circumstances in which that preparation takes place primarily at home.
  *[the Act]: The Act: The Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009
  *[Stimulus Materials]: Stimulus Materials: Materials provided to the Learner before or at the time of the assessment which facilitate the Learner’s demonstration of his or her knowledge, skills and understanding. Tasks in an assessment may relate directly to the materials and a Learner may make direct reference to the materials in completing the assessment. Such materials may include, for example, charts, diagrams, pictures, quotations or machinery.
  *[Reasonable Adjustments]: Reasonable Adjustment: An adjustment made to an assessment for a qualification so as to enable a disabled Learner to demonstrate his or her knowledge, skills and understanding to the levels of attainment required by the specification for that qualification.
  *[Reasonable Adjustment]: Reasonable Adjustment: An adjustment made to an assessment for a qualification so as to enable a disabled Learner to demonstrate his or her knowledge, skills and understanding to the levels of attainment required by the specification for that qualification.

    2. (b) may only make available the qualification where it has evidence of sufficient support from Users of qualifications.

  1. E1.4 For the purposes of Condition E1.3, the following considerations will in particular be relevant in determining what constitutes sufficient support – 
    1. (a) the objective of the new qualification,
    2. (b) whether the new qualification is intended to facilitate a particular route of progression for Learners, and
    3. (c) the number of Learners that the awarding organisation reasonably estimates is likely to take the new qualification.

  1. E1.5 For the purposes of this condition, Users of qualifications will be deemed to support a new qualification if the prevailing view of those Users of qualifications is that the qualification would provide a benefit to Learners.

### Guidance on Condition E1

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * describes the objective of its qualifications accurately and clearly;
  * builds into its arrangements for the design and development of its qualifications time and resources to gather, consider and respond to potential Users’ views;
  * seeks views from a range of potential Users of the qualification and listens and responds to their views;
  * records the evidence it has of User support;
  * makes available or puts forward for accreditation specific support from informed potential Users.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * is the subject of complaints from Users that its qualifications are not meeting the intended objectives;
  * makes available or puts forward for accreditation (where required) qualifications that do not have specific support from informed potential Users;
  * ignores feedback received regarding support for a qualification;
  * has support that refers to the awarding organisation or the qualification type, rather than clearly relating to the proposed qualification and its subject.

    4. (d) a concise indication of the content of the qualification, and
    5. (e) any Endorsement known at the time the qualification is submitted to the Register.

  1. E2.2 An awarding organisation must, in addition – 
    1. (a) ensure that the title on the Register reflects the knowledge, skills and understanding which will be assessed as part of the qualification, and
    2. (b) take all reasonable steps to ensure that the title allows Users of qualifications to identify similar units or qualifications which it makes available or are made available by other awarding organisations.

  1. E2.3 An awarding organisation must ensure that each qualification which it makes available, or proposes to make available, has a title which it uses consistently in its advertising and in its communications with Users of qualifications.

  1. E2.4 An awarding organisation must ensure that the titles of qualifications which it makes available, or proposes to make available, are not misleading to Users of qualifications.

  1. E2.5 An awarding organisation must ensure that it amends the title on the Register for a qualification which it makes available when it makes any revision to a level assigned to that qualification.

### Guidance on Condition E2

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The title of a qualification:

  * includes the name of the awarding organisation in full or in abbreviated form if the abbreviated form is widely used and recognised;
  * includes the level of the qualification which has been determined by reference to the level descriptors in accordance with the requirements referred to in Condition E9.3;
  * only includes the term ‘NVQ’ if the qualification is based on recognised occupational standards, confers occupational competence and requires work-based assessment and/or assessment in an environment that simulates the work place;
  * only uses the terms – 
    * ‘award’ to indicate a small-sized qualification (i.e. a qualification that has a TQT value of 120 or less);
    * ‘certificate’ to indicate a medium-sized qualification (i.e. a qualification that has a TQT value in the range 121-369)
    * ‘diploma’ to indicate a large-sized qualification (i.e. a qualification with a TQT value of 370 or more);

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The title of a qualification includes:

  * terms that are misleading or cannot be justified, for example – 
    * terms associated with higher education qualifications that are referenced to the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications such as Honours, Masters, Graduate and Postgraduate;
    * terms that cannot be justified such as ‘higher’, ‘extended’ or ‘advanced’ when the qualification is not provided as a progression route from another qualification;
    * subjective statements about the qualification which may be misleading;

organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation’s specifications:

  * are developed using a clear approach and are subject to appropriate quality assurance and sign-off arrangements;
  * set out the learning aims and objectives for the qualification clearly, so that Users are able to take informed decisions about the suitability of the qualification for their purposes;
  * are readily available to Users, for example through the awarding organisation’s website, and provide clear contact information where queries about the specification can be raised.

The awarding organisation:

  * engages with Users of qualifications (for example through employer forums or external focus groups) while it is developing the specification (for example about the qualification’s content, structure, purpose and accessibility), and considers the feedback as part of its ongoing review of the specification and the development of future specifications.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * makes implausible, unjustifiable or misleading claims about a qualification relating Learners’ progression to other qualifications or employment;
  * publishes specifications which are not accessible, clear and accurate.

## Condition E4 - Ensuring an assessment is fit for purpose and can be

  3. (b) assure itself that the qualification complies with the requirements of its Conditions of Recognition, making any changes to the qualification which are necessary for that purpose.

### Guidance on Condition E5

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * before submitting a qualification to the Register or for accreditation, ensures it is reviewed against the relevant Conditions, taking account and recording the outcome of: 
    * feedback from Users on their views about the benefit the qualification would provide to Learners;
    * the clarity of the qualification’s objective and the extent to which the qualification is likely to meet its objective;
    * the rationale for the proposed assessment framework, and the extent to which it would facilitate the valid assessment of the required knowledge and skills;
    * the achievability of the plans for the awarding organisation and/or Centres to recruit, train, standardise and monitor the performance of Assessors to facilitate valid assessment;
  * makes any improvements to a qualification highlighted by the reviewer(s) before it is submitted to the Register or for accreditation;
  * authorises only a person(s) of appropriate competence to confirm that the qualification complies with the requirements of its Conditions of Recognition and is ready to be submitted to the Register or for accreditation;
  * uses any lessons learned from previous accreditation decisions (where relevant) to strengthen its approach to reviewing and signing off its proposals prior to their submission for accreditation or to the Register.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * does not subject a qualification to review before submitting it to the Register or for accreditation;
  * does not, without justification, make any changes to the qualification that are highlighted as necessary by the review process;
  * submits a qualification to the Register or for accreditation even though (including but not limited to): 
    * it does not have evidence that the qualification has support from employers, employer representatives or relevant professional bodies;
    * there is no rationale for the proposed assessment framework;

  1. E7.5 Following any review by Ofqual of the number of hours assigned to a qualification in respect of Total Qualification Time or Guided Learning, an awarding organisation must revise that number in any manner required by Ofqual.

### Application

  1. E7.6 Conditions E7.1 to E7.5 shall not apply to an awarding organisation until such date as is specified in, or determined under, any notice in writing issued by Ofqual to the awarding organisation under this paragraph.

  1. E7.7 Any such notice issued by Ofqual may be – 
    1. (a) subject to any conditions that Ofqual specifies (which may include conditions placing requirements on an awarding organisation as to its conduct prior to the date specified in or determined under it),
    2. (b) issued to an individual awarding organisation or to any group of awarding organisations,
    3. (c) issued in respect of one or more qualifications or descriptions of qualifications,
    4. (d) varied by Ofqual at any time prior to the date specified in or determined under it.

  1. E7.8 Where Ofqual makes such a notice subject to conditions, an awarding organisation to which the notice is issued must comply with any requirements that are imposed on it in accordance with those conditions.

### Interpretation

  1. E7.9 For the purposes of this condition, references to a ‘qualification’ are references to the qualification as a whole and not to individual units.

### Guidance on Condition E7

Values for Total Qualification Time, including Guided Learning, are calculated
by considering the different activities that Learners would typically complete
to achieve and demonstrate the learning outcomes of a qualification. They do
not include activities which are required by a Learner’s Teacher based on the
requirements of an individual Learner and/or cohort. Individual Learners’
requirements and individual teaching styles mean there will be variation in
the actual time taken to complete a qualification. Values for Total
Qualification Time, including Guided Learning, are estimates.

Some examples of activities which can contribute to Total Qualification Time
include

  * Independent and unsupervised research/learning
  * Unsupervised compilation of a portfolio of work experience
  * Unsupervised e-learning
  * Unsupervised e-assessment
  * Unsupervised coursework
  * Watching a pre-recorded podcast or webinar
  * Unsupervised work-based learning
  * All Guided Learning

Some examples of activities which can contribute to Guided Learning include:

  * Classroom-based learning supervised by a Teacher
  * Work-based learning supervised by a Teacher
  * Live webinar or telephone tutorial with a Teacher in real time
  * E-learning supervised by a Teacher in real time
  * All forms of assessment which take place under the Immediate Guidance or Supervision of a lecturer, supervisor, tutor or other appropriate provider of education or training, including where the assessment is competence-based and may be turned into a learning opportunity.

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * has Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values for its qualifications that are broadly in line with similar qualifications;
  * can explain its decision about the Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values for its qualifications where these values differ from those of similar qualifications;
  * considers and responds to the views of potential Users of the qualifications on the proposed Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values and builds into its qualification development process the time to do so;
  * has and retains evidence to support its assignment from informed potential and/or existing Users of qualifications about the Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values;
  * gathers, considers and responds to the views of existing Users of the qualification to review the Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values and builds into its arrangements for the review of its qualifications the time and resources to do so;
  * can explain its decision about the Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values required for the qualification, with reference to the available evidence and the intended cohort for the qualification;
  * where it makes an assignment before the qualification is first made available, gathers and considers evidence of the actual time typically taken by Learners in the first cohort to complete the qualification and revises the number of hours of Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning if appropriate;
  * considers feedback from Users of qualifications about the accuracy of values assigned to a qualification for Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning, and revises those values if appropriate.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation –

  * does not review its approach to calculating the number of hours for Total Qualification Time and/or Guided Learning following complaints or in response to negative feedback about that approach;
  * does not review the number of hours assigned to a qualification for Total Qualification Time and/or Guided Learning following complaints or in response to negative feedback in relation to that number of hours;
  * disregards feedback and evidence from Users of qualifications about the Total Qualification Time and/or Guided Learning values required;
  * has Total Qualification Time and/or Guided Learning values for a qualification that are not comparable with those of similar qualifications and lacks evidence to support the difference in values.

### Guidance on Condition E10

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation’s published policy for Recognition of Prior Learning
(RPL):

  * is open, transparent and clear to Learners and Users of qualifications;
  * in any circumstances where the awarding organisation chooses to recognise prior learning: 
    * sets out the evidence of prior learning that will be required by the awarding organisation;

The awarding organisation ensures that:

  * any decisions on an application for RPL are carried out by staff who are competent to consider and make decisions about RPL;
  * its policy for RPL is regularly reviewed and, where appropriate, amended; and
  * any qualification awarded to a Learner who has made a successful application for RPL provides a valid and reliable indication of that Learner’s knowledge, skills and understanding.

##  Total Qualification Time Criteria

## Level requirements (including level descriptors)

  1. General Condition E9.3(c) allows us to specify requirements which an awarding organisation must follow when assigning – 
    1. (a) a level to a qualification,
    2. (b) more than one level to a qualification, and
    3. (c) a level to a Component of a qualification.
  2. We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition E9.3(c) below.

### Assigning a level to a qualification

When assigning a level to each of its qualifications in accordance with
Condition E9.1, an awarding organisation must use the level descriptors set
out below to select the most appropriate level to assign to that
qualification.

### Assigning more than one level to a qualification

  1. When assigning more than one level to a qualification an awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) be satisfied that the range of achievement recognised by the qualification is sufficient to span more than one level,
    2. (b) use the level descriptors set out below to select the most appropriate levels to assign to that qualification,
    3. (c) have a clear rationale for assigning more than one level to that qualification, and
    4. (d) publish that rationale.

### Assigning a level to a component of a qualification

  1. When assigning a level to a Component of a qualification in accordance with Condition E9.2 an awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) use the level descriptors set out below to select the most appropriate level to assign to that Component, and
    2. (b) take all reasonable steps to ensure that the level assigned to each Component is appropriate when considered against the level assigned to the qualification as a whole.

### Level descriptors

The level descriptors are divided into two categories –

  * knowledge and understanding; and
  * skills.

There is a knowledge descriptor and a skills descriptor for each level within
the framework. The descriptors apply to all the qualifications we regulate,
general and vocational, and so many of the descriptors have an “and/or”
construction to indicate their applicability to the knowledge and skills
associated with the study of a subject or in preparation for a job or role.

The level descriptors build on those used within the Qualifications and Credit
Framework (QCF) and the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). Levels 4-8
are intended to be consistent with the five levels within the Framework for
Higher Education Qualification in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (FHEQ).

The descriptors set out the generic knowledge and skills associated with the
typical holder of a qualification at that level. The level descriptors are
framed as outcomes and each category starts with a stem statement (“the holder
can…”) which then links into the outcomes associated with each level of the
framework.

The descriptors for the knowledge and skills associated with Entry 1
achievement are the exception to this. The Entry 1 descriptors are based on a
continuum of achievement which can be used to track and recognise progress
towards the achievement of student-centred targets.

None of the descriptors is intended to point to the process of learning or to
specific assessment methods.

Level | Knowledge descriptor (the holder…) | Skills descriptor (the holder can…)  
---|---|---  
Entry 1 | Progresses along a continuum that ranges from the most elementary of achievements to beginning to make use of knowledge and/or understanding that relate to the subject or immediate environment. | Progress along a continuum that ranges from the most elementary of achievements to beginning to make use of skills that relate to the subject or the immediate environment.  
Entry 2 | Has basic knowledge or understanding of a subject and/or can carry out simple, familiar tasks; and

### Guidance on level and level descriptors

General Condition E9.3(c) allows us to specify guidance to which an awarding
organisation must have regard when assigning –  
(a) a level to a qualification  
(b) more than one level to a qualification  
(c) a level to a Component of a qualification  
  

We set out our guidance for the purposes of Condition E9.3(c) below.

### Who can use the level descriptors?

The level descriptors must be used by awarding organisations when they are
assigning a level to a qualification and a Component of a qualification. Level
descriptors can also be used by –

  * students and other Users – to understand and interpret the level of qualifications,
  * anyone who wants to understand more about the difference between and relative demand of qualifications at different levels.

### How should awarding organisations use the level descriptors?

Awarding organisations should look at the range of level descriptors and
identify the descriptor (or where the qualification will have more than one
level, the descriptors) which provides the best match with the intended
knowledge and skills outcomes for their qualification. Once the awarding
organisation has designed the qualification, they could look at the descriptor
for the level above and below the proposed level for the qualification and
compare the knowledge and skills descriptors for each level with the
knowledge, skills and understanding which the holder of the qualification is
expected to demonstrate. The fit does not have to be perfect; qualifications
might naturally have a more knowledge- or skills-based focus and so will be a
better fit with the knowledge or skills descriptor as appropriate.  

Awarding organisations can also look at a range of other material to support
the selection of the most appropriate level for their qualification including
other qualifications at a range of levels, benchmark and content statements
and agreed industry statements.  

Awarding organisations and users should not expect all qualifications to meet
the relevant level descriptor in full. It would not be unusual for smaller
qualifications to cover only some of the characteristics set out in the
descriptor whereas bigger qualifications, typically taken over a longer
period, are more likely to feature more of the characteristics. The
descriptors set out what the typical holder of a qualification at that level
will know and be able to do based on the best-fit approach described above.  

Awarding organisations and users should not expect all of a qualification’s
content and assessment to be at the level the learner is expected to reach on
conclusion of the qualification. This will be particularly true of
qualifications delivered over a longer period and which are designed to enable
the learner to progress from one level to another within the qualification. In
assigning a level to a qualification the awarding organisation should have
regard to the amount of content and assessment at the level of the
qualification and to the learner’s increased ability as the learner approaches
the end of the qualification.

### How will Ofqual use the descriptors?

We will use the descriptors to inform our review process, particularly when we
are exploring how awarding organisations check and verify the given level of
their qualification with these descriptors for that level.

#  Section F - Providing qualifications to purchasers

Rules about providing information on qualification fees and features,
packaging qualifications with other products or services, and invoicing.

## Condition F1 - Information on fees

### Making fee information available

  1. F1.1 In respect of each of its qualifications that it makes available for purchase, an awarding organisation must publish the following information for potential purchasers in England – 
    1. (a) where possible, the Standard Qualification Fee.
    2. (b) where applicable, any Package Fee.
    3. (c) where possible, any Associated Learner Fees.
    4. (d) where possible, any Mandatory Centre Fees.
    5. (e) where it is not possible for the awarding organisation to calculate a Standard Qualification Fee, Associated Learner Fees or any Mandatory Centre Fees, a statement of the method by which these fees are calculated.

  1. F1.2 An awarding organisation must ensure that the information which it publishes as required by Condition F1.1 is – 
    1. (a) kept up to date,
    2. (b) clear to a potential purchaser, and
    3. (c) easily accessible to any potential purchaser without that person having to request it from, or provide any information to, the awarding organisation.

### Making fee information available to satisfy the planning requirements of
purchasers

  1. F1.3 An awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to publish the information required by Condition F1.1 sufficiently far in advance of the time at which the qualifications to which that information relates will be made available to Learners as to satisfy the reasonable planning requirements of potential purchasers.

  1. F1.4 Where such information cannot be published to this timescale, the awarding organisation must instead provide or make available to potential purchasers information that is sufficient to give a reasonable indication of its likely fees, together with a clear statement to make potential purchasers aware that this information is only indicative.

  1. F1.5 In respect of each of its qualifications that it makes available for purchase, an awarding organisation must make the information set out in Condition F1.1(a) – (e) available for potential purchasers outside England on request.

### Guidance on Condition F1

#### Introduction

Condition F1.1 requires an awarding organisation to publish fees for its
qualifications on its website (in accordance with Condition J1.7(c)).  
  

Condition F1.2 builds on this obligation, requiring awarding organisations to
make fee information easily accessible to any potential purchaser, without
them having to request it from, or provide any information to, the awarding
organisation.  
  

When deciding how this information should be presented, and how particular
services should be identified and categorised, an awarding organisation must
have regard to this guidance.  
  

##### Use of defined terms

Awarding organisations are not obliged to use the defined terms ‘Standard
Qualification Fee’, ‘Package Fee’, ‘Associated Learner Fees’ or ‘Mandatory
Centre Fees’ that we have published in Condition J1.8 when publishing fee
information.  
  

Where these defined terms are not used, however, the awarding organisation
should make clear which fee constitutes the Standard Qualification Fee and, if
applicable, the Package Fee for each qualification. In addition, the awarding
organisation should make clear which fees constitute the Associated Learner
Fees and Mandatory Centre Fees categories.  
  

Each fee, however it is labelled, should represent all of the information that
must be covered by the Standard Qualification Fee, Package Fee, Associated
Learner Fees or Mandatory Centre Fees respectively, as set out in the
Conditions of Recognition and the guidance below.  
  

##### Publication “where possible”

Condition F1.1 requires awarding organisations to publish the Standard
Qualification Fee, any Associated Learner Fees and any Mandatory Centre Fees
“where possible”. This means that the requirement will apply in almost all
circumstances.  
  

Where, in accordance with Condition F1.1(e), it is not possible for an
awarding organisation to calculate a Standard Qualification Fee, Associated
Learner Fees or any Mandatory Centre Fees, the awarding organisation must
publish a statement of the method by which these fees are calculated. We
consider that this will only apply in exceptional circumstances, where the
awarding organisation can demonstrate that complying with the requirements of
one or more of Conditions F1.1(a) to F1.1(d) is not possible. Any statement of
method must be clear and readily capable of being understood by potential
purchasers.  
  

##### The “purchaser”

Condition F1 refers to purchasers and potential purchasers of qualifications.
This term is not defined in Condition J1.8, and therefore has its ordinary
meaning: anyone who pays (or, in the case of potential purchasers, might pay)
the awarding organisation’s fees for the qualification.  
  

In many cases, the purchaser will be a Centre. This will be the case whenever
a Centre pays any of the awarding organisation’s fees for the qualification,
irrespective of whether or not the Centre subsequently recharges those fees to
individual Learners. It also includes situations where a Centre pays a fee to
the awarding organisation on behalf of one or more Learners.  
  

Individual Learners can also be purchasers (or potential purchasers) for the
purposes of Condition F1. This will be the case whenever individual Learners
pay (or might pay) any fees directly to the awarding organisation.  
  

##### Application to markets outside England

While Ofqual-regulated qualifications are regulated by Ofqual wherever in the
world they are taken, Ofqual’s requirement to publish fees in Condition F1.1
applies only in respect of potential purchasers in England.  
  

For potential purchasers outside England, our Condition F1.5 applies. This
requires awarding organisations to make fee information available on request.  
  

Awarding organisations should be aware that CCEA Regulation and Qualifications
Wales have equivalent rules, and that these require publication of fee
information for potential purchasers in Northern Ireland and Wales
(respectively).

#### Standard Qualification Fee

The Standard Qualification Fee is intended to offer clarity to purchasers or
potential purchasers about mandatory fees.  
  

The Standard Qualification Fee must include all mandatory fees that must be
paid in respect of a single Learner progressing from registration for the
qualification through to certification. As such, it should include, but is not
be limited to, any fees for:

  * qualification/unit entry
  * assessment carried out by the awarding organisation
  * marking carried out by the awarding organisation and/or Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny, including Moderation (if these are payable in respect of for individual Learners)
  * mandatory assessment materials (if these must be purchased from the awarding organisation)
  * notification of results
  * issuing of certificates

In calculating a Standard Qualification Fee, an awarding organisation should
assume the Learner completes all assessments at the first attempt.  
  

The Standard Qualification Fee should reflect current prices. An awarding
organisation may have different fees for different optional routes through a
qualification. Where that is the case, the Standard Qualification Fee should
reflect the most likely combination of options Learners will take in order to
be awarded the qualification.

Example 1  
---  
There are three optional routes (Options A, B and C) through a qualification,
each priced differently. Option A is typically taken by 15% of Learners,
Option B by 25% and Option C by 60%.  
  
The Standard Qualification Fee should therefore reflect the price of Option C.  
Example 2  
---  
An awarding organisation is introducing a new qualification with two
differently-priced optional routes through it (Options A and B). It expects,
based on entry patterns for similar qualifications it has offered in the past,
that more Learners will take Option B.  
  
When the qualification is made available for the first time, the Standard
Qualification Fee should therefore reflect the fees for Option B.  
  
Once it starts awarding the qualification, the awarding organisation observes
that around 70% of Learners are in fact taking Option A. The awarding
organisation then revises its published Standard Qualification Fee to reflect
the fees for Option A.  
  
An awarding organisation is not required to publish a breakdown explaining how
it has calculated the Standard Qualification Fee, but equally is not precluded
from doing so.  
  

An awarding organisation can also choose to publish information which
specifies or illustrates costs of alternative options (or combinations of
options) that may be relevant for potential purchasers.  
  

It is of course open for awarding organisations to negotiate discounts on any
of its fees (including those that fall within the Standard Qualification Fee)
with potential purchasers, for example based on their expected cohort size, or
to reflect their role in developing or delivering the qualification.  
  

##### Fees excluded from the Standard Qualification Fee

Some fees should not be included in the Standard Qualification Fee. In most
cases, awarding organisations must still publish these fees in order to comply
with Conditions F1.1(b) to F1.1(d).  
  

Examples of fees that should be excluded from the Standard Qualification Fee
might include:

  * periodic or one-off Learner registration fees (to be included in Associated Learner Fees)
  * periodic or one-off professional membership fees (if obligatory and payable to the awarding organisation, to be included in Associated Learner Fees)
  * fees for Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny (including Moderation) payable in respect of a group of Learners (to be included in Mandatory Centre Fees)
  * fees for learning materials not required for assessment (if obligatory and purchased from the awarding organisation, then this would be a Package Fee)
  * fees for any goods or services required to be purchased alongside the qualification, as a package (to be included in a Package Fee)
  * any fee charged by a Centre to a Learner which is not payable to, or otherwise required by, the awarding organisation. Examples of such fees might include Centre charges for delivering or carrying out assessments, or for raw materials used in assessments.

Example 3  
---  
An awarding organisation charges a one-off registration fee the first time a
Learner attempts one of the awarding organisation’s qualifications. This fee
is not charged if the Learner takes the same qualification again, or has
previously paid the fee when taking another of the awarding organisation’s
qualifications.  
  
Since this fee is not payable every time a Learner takes the qualification, it
should not be included in the Standard Qualification Fee.  
  
However, it would be an Associated Learner Fee, and the awarding organisation
would still need to publish it to comply with Condition F1.1(c).  
Example 4  
---  
An awarding organisation also acts as a membership body. It requires Learners
to join that membership body in order to take one of its qualifications. It
charges a membership fee every time a Learner attempts that qualification,
irrespective of whether or not the Learner has previously paid a membership
fee.  
  
This fee must be included in the Standard Qualification Fee.  
Example 5  
---  
An awarding organisation also acts as a professional body. It requires
Learners taking its qualifications to be members of that professional body,
which charges an annual membership fee.  
  
Because Learners do not need to pay the membership fee every time they attempt
one of the awarding organisation’s qualifications, it should not be included
in the Standard Qualification Fee.  
  
However, it would be an Associated Learner Fee, and the awarding organisation
would still need to publish it in order to comply with Condition F1.1(c).  
  
In accordance with Condition E3.2(e), the qualification’s specification must
also make clear that a Learner must be a member of the professional body in
order to be assessed.  
  
#### Package Fee

Where an awarding organisation only makes a qualification available in a
package with other products or services, the Package Fee represents the
notional fees for those other products or services that are required to be
purchased along with the qualification. The fee should not include the
Standard Qualification Fee for the qualification itself.  
  

If the awarding organisation makes the qualification available for purchase
separately to the package, then the awarding organisation does not have to
publish a Package Fee. It can, instead, publish details of the package
alongside the Standard Qualification Fee, making clear this is an additional
option.

#### Associated Learner Fees

Associated Learner Fees encompass all fees for optional services directly
related to the delivery and award of a qualification to an individual Learner.
These include, where applicable, the following, and any other relevant fees:

  * late entry
  * reviews of marking (even if these are not charged, or are refunded, in certain circumstances)
  * appeals (even if these may be refunded in certain circumstances)
  * taking the qualification again (if this differs from the Standard Qualification Fee)
  * replacement certificates
  * periodic or one-off Learner registration
  * annual professional membership, where membership is a pre-requisite for taking the qualification (even if the awarding organisation and the membership body are separate entities)

These fees may or may not vary by qualification. Where they do not vary they
need not be repeated.  
  

If the awarding organisation sets fee levels for some elements, such as late
entry fees, as a proportion of the Standard Qualification Fee, then it would
be reasonable to present this fee in that way, rather than publishing the
actual values relevant to each qualification. The awarding organisation’s
overall intention should be for clarity and transparency, in line with
Condition F1.2(b).

#### Mandatory Centre Fees

These fees should represent all mandatory fees that must be paid by a Centre
in order to deliver qualifications, but which would not be included in the
Standard Qualification Fee. These fees would typically be payable in respect
of a group of Learners, or a Centre as a whole.  
  

These include, where applicable, the following, and any other relevant fees:

  * initial Centre approval fees
  * annual Centre fees
  * Moderation fees payable in respect of a group of Learners, or the Centre as a whole
  * fees for periodic, mandatory, visits – for example, for audit or quality assurance
  * fees for any other Centre visits where these are required by the awarding organisation
  * minimum spending thresholds, alongside the terms relating to their application
  * fees related to the delivery of a specific qualification which are payable in respect of a group of Learners
  * fees payable in respect of a group of Learners that are not related to a specific qualification

## Condition F2 - Packaging qualifications with other products or services

### Packages offered as an option

  1. F2.1 Where an awarding organisation makes available a qualification both in a package with other products or services and separately from those other products or services, it must inform purchasers prior to the time of purchase that the qualification may be purchased separately or in a package.

### Packages offered without alternative options

  1. F2.2 An awarding organisation must not make available a qualification in a package together with other products or services unless it also makes available that qualification without other products or services, except where it – 
    1. (a) from time to time seeks comments from purchasers on whether the packaging of the qualification with the particular products or services is appropriate, and
    2. (b) reasonably concludes that continuing to make available the package is appropriate.

### Guidance on Condition F2

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * puts in place, and follows, a policy which includes details of how it will consider whether or not it is appropriate to introduce or continue to make a qualification available in a package together with other products and services.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * does not put in place a policy which includes details of how it will consider whether or not it is appropriate to introduce or continue to make a qualification available in a package together with other products and services, or does not follow such a policy which it has put in place;
  * considers that it is appropriate to make a qualification available in a package together with other products and services where that package has a negative impact on Learners and/or the purchasers of the qualification.

## Condition F3 - Invoicing

### Invoicing purchasers

  1. F3.1 An awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) ensure that its invoices in relation to the provision of qualifications are issued in a timely manner, and
    2. (b) provide a breakdown of its fees, beyond that already required by HMRC, to a reasonable level of detail following a request from a purchaser.

### The written invoicing policy

  1. F3.2 An awarding organisation must establish, maintain, publish and comply with a written policy on invoicing.

  1. F3.3 The policy must specify the processes to be followed by the awarding organisation in relation to the issue, payment and retention of invoices and the content of invoices.

There is currently no guidance on complying with these Conditions

  *[Standard Qualification Fee]: Standard Qualification Fee: A fee which, subject to negotiation, is payable to an awarding organisation by a purchaser that represents the sum of all mandatory fees that must be paid in respect of an individual Learner for that Learner to have the opportunity to obtain one of the awarding organisation's qualifications, including a certificate in relation to it. This would exclude any Learner pre-requisites clearly set out in the qualification specification, for example prior learning or membership of a professional body. Where an awarding organisation only makes a qualification available as part of a package, together with other products and services, the Standard Qualification Fee will be the notional fee payable in respect of the qualification only.
  *[Package Fee]: Package Fee: Where an awarding organisation only makes a qualification available as part of a package together with other products and services, any notional fee which is: subject to negotiation, payable to an awarding organisation by a purchaser of the package in respect of each of those other products and services; and not included in the Standard Qualification Fee.
  *[Associated Learner Fees]: Associated Learner Fees: Any fee which is: subject to negotiation, payable to an awarding organisation by a purchaser for an optional service that is directly related to the delivery and award of a regulated qualification to an individual Learner; and not not included in the Standard Qualification Fee.
  *[Mandatory Centre Fees]: Mandatory Centre Fees: Any mandatory fee which: subject to negotiation, an awarding organisation requires a Centre to pay to it in order to undertake the delivery of an assessment to Learners (or any other activities) on behalf of the awarding organisation, irrespective of the number of Learners taking the qualification; and is not included in the Standard Qualification Fee.
  *[Learners]: Learner: A person who is registered to take a qualification and to be assessed as part of that qualification.
  *[Centre]: Centre: An organisation undertaking the delivery of an assessment (and potentially other activities) to Learners on behalf of an awarding organisation. Centres are typically educational institutions, training providers, or employers.
  *[Learner]: Learner: A person who is registered to take a qualification and to be assessed as part of that qualification.
  *[Assessment Standards Scrutiny]: Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny: The process through which an Awarding Organisation: periodically scrutinises the marking of assessments by a Centre to ensure that it has not deviated from required standards; considers whether it is appropriate to correct any mark and, if appropriate, corrects that mark (including where changes are required under Condition H2.5(b)); in line with Condition H6.3(b), considers whether it is appropriate to correct any incorrect result and, if appropriate, corrects that result; and takes action to prevent such deviation from recurring.
  *[Moderation]: Moderation: A particular form of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny through which the marking of assessments by Centres is monitored to make sure it meets required standards and through which adjustments to a Centre’s marking are made, where required, to ensure that results are based on the required standard. Moderation takes place before final results are issued under Condition H6.1.

#  Section G - Setting and delivering the assessment

Rules about setting and delivering assessments, including about the language
of assessments, maintaining confidentiality of assessments, reasonable
adjustments and special consideration

## Condition G1 - Setting the assessment

  1. G1.1 In setting an assessment for a qualification which it makes available, an awarding organisation must ensure that the content of the assessment is – 
    1. (a) fit for purpose,
    2. (b) appropriate for the method of assessment chosen, and
    3. (c) consistent with the specification for that qualification.

  1. G1.2 An awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Level of Demand of an assessment for a qualification which it makes available is consistent – 
    1. (a) across all options as to tasks which may be completed by a Learner for the purposes of the assessment,
    2. (b) with the Level of Demand of any other assessment which may be completed by a Learner as an alternative to the assessment, for the purpose of the qualification, and
    3. (c) with the Level of Demand of previous assessments and of any specimen assessment materials which the awarding organisation has published in relation to the qualification.

  1. G1.3 An awarding organisation must produce a written document in relation to an assessment which sets out clear and unambiguous criteria against which Learners’ levels of attainment will be differentiated.

### Guidance on Condition G1

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * sets assessments, or where applicable, ensures that its Centres set assessments, which: 
    * include only content that is drawn from the knowledge, skills and understanding in the specification and which ensure that the Level of Demand of the assessment is consistent with previous assessments;
    * make it possible for Learners to demonstrate, and the awarding organisation or Centre to measure, the extent to which they have the knowledge, skills and understanding required by the qualification;
    * allow the specified level of attainment set out in the specification to be reached by a Learner who has attained the required level of knowledge, skills and understanding;
    * use methods of assessment that are valid and are appropriate to the knowledge, skills and understanding being measured;
    * effectively differentiate between Learners (that is, solely on the basis of the knowledge, skills and understanding being assessed);
    * accurately measure the knowledge, skills and understanding they are intended to measure;
  * additionally, for graded qualifications, sets assessments, or ensures its Centres set assessments, which: 
    * cover the full range of demands targeted by the assessment;
    * enable the full range of Learners targeted by the assessment to demonstrate the extent to which they have the knowledge, skills and understanding required by the qualification;
    * enable the awarding organisation to differentiate effectively between Learners (that is, solely on the basis of the knowledge, skills and understanding being assessed) across the range of attainment targeted by the assessment;
  * has a clear rationale for any optional routes through a qualification, combinations or pathways and can explain how, as far as is possible, these are comparable in terms of the Level of Demand and the amount of subject content required to be taught and on which Learners will be assessed;
  * keeps its assessments under review, amending them where necessary, to ensure they remain fit for purpose, for example by reflecting new requirements, good practice or legislation.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * sets assessments which: 
    * do not allow it to measure the extent to which Learners have the knowledge, skills and understanding required by the qualification;
    * are not manageable for Centres or Learners, for example because of the availability of equipment, materials or resources;
    * discriminate between Learners on the basis of factors other than the knowledge, skills and understanding being measured by the qualification, for example because of the context in which questions/tasks are set;
    * include content which is not covered by the specification;
    * have options, routes or pathways through the qualification which are not of the same Level of Demand;
  * uses an assessment procedure which does not measure the knowledge, skills and understanding required by the qualification with sufficient accuracy;
  * does not take appropriate corrective action where it identifies assessments which do not meet these requirements.

## Condition G2 - Language of the assessment

  1. G2.1 An awarding organisation must ensure that all Learners taking its qualifications in England are assessed in English, except to the extent that the use of another language is permitted by this condition.

  1. G2.2 A Learner taking a qualification may be assessed in British Sign Language where it is permitted by an awarding organisation for the purpose of Reasonable Adjustment.

  1. G2.3 A Learner taking a qualification may be assessed in any other language where it is one of the primary objectives of the qualification – 
    1. (a) for the Learner to gain knowledge of, skills in, and understanding of that language, or
    2. (b) to support a role in the workplace, providing that proficiency in English is not required for the role supported by the qualification.

  1. G2.4 Where an awarding organisation makes available a qualification in more than one language, the awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure that assessments in different languages ensure a consistent Level of Demand for Learners.

There is currently no guidance on complying with these Conditions

## Condition G3 - Use of language and Stimulus Materials

  1. G3.1 An awarding organisation must ensure that assessments for qualifications which it makes available use only appropriate language and Stimulus Materials.

  1. G3.2 Language and Stimulus Materials are only appropriate if they – 
    1. (a) enable Learners to demonstrate their level of attainment,
    2. (b) require knowledge, skills and understanding which are required for the qualification,
    3. (c) are clear and unambiguous (unless ambiguity forms part of the assessment), and
    4. (d) are not likely to cause unnecessary offence to Learners.

  1. G3.3 In considering whether language and Stimulus Materials for an assessment are appropriate, an awarding organisation must take into account in particular – 
    1. (a) the age of Learners who may reasonably be expected to take the qualification,
    2. (b) the level of the qualification,
    3. (c) the objective of the qualification, and
    4. (d) the knowledge, skills and understanding assessed for the qualification.

  1. G3.4 An awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure that no assessment for a qualification which it makes available contains language or Stimulus Materials which could lead a group of Learners who share a common attribute or circumstance to experience – because of that attribute or circumstance – an unreasonable disadvantage in the level of attainment that they are able to demonstrate in the assessment.

The guidance on Condition G3 has been replaced with [broader guidance that is
set out at the end of Condition D](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-
handbook/section-d-general-requirements-for-regulated-qualifications#guidance-
for-designing-and-developing-accessible-assessments).

## Condition G4 - Maintaining confidentiality of assessment materials

  1. G4.1 Where confidentiality in – 
    1. (a) the contents of assessment materials, or
    2. (b) information about the assessment,
  2. is required in order to ensure that a qualification which an awarding organisation makes available, or proposes to make available, reflects an accurate measure of attainment, the awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure that such confidentiality is maintained.

  1. G4.2 An awarding organisation – 
    1. (a) must take all reasonable steps to ensure that such confidentiality is maintained where it (or any person connected or previously connected to it) provides training or training materials in relation to such a qualification,
    2. (b) must not provide or endorse any prohibited training, and
    3. (c) must take all reasonable steps to ensure that any person connected or previously connected to it does not provide or endorse any prohibited training.

  1. G4.3 For the purposes of this condition, ‘prohibited training’ is training – 
    1. (a) provided to Teachers in relation to such a qualification,
    2. (b) at which a number of persons are present (whether physically or remotely by means of simultaneous electronic communication),
    3. (c) where any one of those persons holds information in relation to the content of assessment materials or information about the assessment for that qualification, and
    4. (d) where disclosure of the information to Teachers would breach such confidentiality.

  1. G4.4 An awarding organisation must, in respect of any training it provides to Teachers in relation to such a qualification (and, in relation to any such training provided by any person connected to it, must take all reasonable steps to) – 
    1. (a) ensure that the training is reasonably available to all Teachers preparing Learners, or persons likely to become Learners, for assessments for that qualification,
    2. (b) advertise to Teachers the availability of the training, including in particular by publishing details of the training, and
    3. (c) publish the content of any training materials which have been provided to Teachers in connection with the training, as soon as reasonably practicable after the training has been held.

  1. G4.5 An awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure that - 
    1. (a) no person connected to it, or previously connected to it, and
    2. (b) in particular, no Teacher or other third party who has had access to confidential assessment materials,
  2. discloses, or offers to disclose, information about any assessment or the content of any assessment materials where that information is (or is said or implied to be) confidential.

  1. G4.6 Where any breach of such confidentiality (including through the loss or theft of confidential assessment materials) is either suspected by an awarding organisation or alleged by any other person and where there are reasonable grounds for that suspicion or allegation, the awarding organisation must: 
    1. (a) investigate that breach,
    2. (b) ensure that such an investigation is carried out rigorously, effectively, and by persons of appropriate competence who have no personal interest in its outcome, and
    3. (c) so far as possible, establish whether or not a breach of such confidentiality has occurred.

### Guidance on Condition G4

You may want to read our [guidance on conflicts of
interest](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-a-
governance#coi-guidance).

In the guidance below ‘confidential assessment information’ refers to both the
contents of assessment materials and information about the assessment in
relation to which confidentiality must be maintained under Condition G4.1.

#### Third party activities covered by Condition G4

An awarding organisation must ensure that it takes appropriate steps to meet
the requirements of Condition G4 in relation to its own employees.

Awarding organisations are also likely to contract with a variety of third
parties in relation to the development and delivery of assessments, many of
whom will have access to confidential assessment information. This will
include not only those persons who set questions and quality assure the
assessments but also those involved in printing assessments and distributing
them to Centres. For online assessments it may also include any third party
that hosts the platform through which an assessment is provided.

Condition G4.1 requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps
to ensure confidentiality is not breached by anyone during any part of the
assessment development and delivery process.

For the purposes of Conditions G4.3 to G4.5, awarding organisations should
also remember that the term ‘Teacher’, as defined in Condition J1.8, includes
not only qualified teaching staff in schools and colleges, but also covers
home-schooling parents, private tutors and employers providing training to
Learners in relation to vocational qualifications.

#### Confidential information

Condition G4.1 refers to confidentiality in respect of:

  1. (a) the contents of assessment materials, and
  2. (b) information about the assessment for a qualification.

This covers any information which, if divulged inappropriately, could impact
on the validity and/or reliability of an assessment. Information about when or
how particular knowledge, skills or understanding will be assessed will be
confidential if the assessment was designed in a way that assumes the Learner
will not know that information before taking the assessment.

For some assessments, it might be enough to maintain confidentiality in
relation to information about specific questions. For other assessments,
knowledge of a broad overview about the topics to be set or the general
structure of the paper might compromise the ability of the assessment to
measure the Learner’s attainment effectively.

#### Examples of training that is not prohibited

Provided that confidentiality, as defined by Condition G4.1, is not breached
and all other regulatory requirements are met, training for Teachers can be
delivered if it:

  * does not relate to a particular regulated qualification; or
  * is about a particular regulated qualification but does not involve the presence of anyone with information about that qualification that must not be shared with Teachers and Learners. This could include where the training is attended by persons who: 
    * had sight of the contents of previous assessments that are part of the current specification but have no confidential information on assessments that have yet to be taken; or
    * had confidential information about assessments for an earlier specification for the same qualification but do not have confidential assessment information in relation to the current specification.

Where a staff member with confidential information about qualification A
attends a training event in relation to qualification B, that training will
not become prohibited training simply because an attendee asks, or might ask,
a question about qualification A. If the answer to the question would involve
the staff member breaching confidentiality, he or she should simply decline to
answer it, and could refer the questioner to publicly available information.

Condition G4.2 concerns the provision of training. ‘Training’ should be given
its ordinary meaning and, in general terms, will usually encompass meetings –
attended either in person or remotely – at which attendees are either taught a
particular skill or provided with information in relation to a particular
regulated qualification, with the aim of better equipping them to deliver that
qualification. The obligations in Conditions G4.2 and G4.4 will not,
therefore, apply to meetings with Teachers where the purpose is to facilitate
the development or design of a particular regulated qualification by an
awarding organisation.

However, it is important to note that meetings with Teachers, at which the
primary purpose is not to provide training, may incorporate a training
element. We expect awarding organisations to consider carefully whether each
particular meeting with Teachers will provide training to them and, if so,
whether any such training will adhere to the requirements in Conditions
G4.2(a) and G4.4.

Likewise, a staff member with confidential information will not automatically
be providing prohibited training if he or she takes a telephone call from, or
otherwise talks to, a Teacher. However, prohibited training will include one-
to-one training where all of the elements of the definition in Condition G4.2
are met. The staff member, therefore, must not disclose confidential
information when answering a question.

Pre-recorded training – such as a webinar – from someone with confidential
information will not fall within the definition of ‘prohibited training’ under
Condition G4.3 because that person would not be ‘present’ under the definition
of that term in Condition G4.3(b), which concerns the use of simultaneous
electronic communication. The awarding organisation would, of course, need to
comply with Condition G4.2(a) in that the pre-recorded training could not
disclose information that would breach Condition G4.1. It must also comply
with the obligation under Condition G4.4(c) concerning the publication of
training materials.

The above examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not exhaustive.

#### Training on Centre-marked assessment

Condition G4 allows a distinction to be made between:

(a) information that can be shared with Teachers that they must not then pass
on to their Learners (for example, in the context of training on how to
conduct Centre-marked assessments); and

(b) information that neither Teachers nor Learners should see because this
would breach the requirement of confidentiality in Condition G4.1.

So, for example, if an awarding organisation was to share model answers or
exemplar work at a training event where Teachers were being standardised in
relation to Centre-marked assessments, this would be permissible under
Condition G4.2(b). This is because the event falls outside the definition of
‘prohibited training’.

However, although the disclosure of such information to Teachers would not
breach confidentiality as defined by Condition G4.1, an awarding organisation
must take all reasonable steps to ensure that such information is not passed
on to Learners where this would affect the ability of the assessment to
reflect an accurate measure of attainment.

A person can attend a training event if he or she holds only confidential
information in relation to the qualification that, if disclosed to Teachers,
would not breach the requirement of confidentiality in Condition G4.1. One
such example would be if the person held confidential information in relation
to the standardisation of marking in Centre-marked assessment only.

However, a person could not attend such training if he or she holds
confidential information in relation to external assessment for that
qualification as that information, if disclosed to Teachers, would breach the
requirement of confidentiality in Condition G4.1.

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * is clear which assessment materials and information are confidential;
  * monitors who has had access to confidential assessment information and the extent to which this is the case (for example if they have seen entire assessments or parts or assessments), for each of its qualifications;
  * trains relevant staff about how to protect confidential assessment information, including during interactions with Teachers;
  * puts in place and monitors the application of confidentiality policies and processes for its staff and third parties, which include – 
    * details on how to maintain confidentiality during interactions with Teachers; and
    * provision in relation to the protection of confidentiality by staff and third parties who have access to confidential assessment information through the assessment development process, including quality assurance (in relation to which, see our overarching guidance on safeguarding confidentiality where Teachers are involved in developing assessments);
  * makes sure that, where it provides training to Centres about how to set, deliver or mark assessments, the Centre is trained on how to protect confidential assessment information and maintain confidentiality, and the training itself is designed and delivered to minimise the risk of a breach of confidentiality by the future disclosure of materials provided in connection with the training;
  * monitors the training and training materials that it delivers to make sure confidential information is not shared at events, for example by: 
    * reviewing training materials before they are used;
    * reviewing recordings of training events;
    * sending observers to monitor samples of training events;
  * requires all current (and former) staff and third parties who have had access to confidential assessment information in relation to a particular qualification to apply in writing for the awarding organisation’s permission before providing, endorsing or attending any Teacher training events in respect of that qualification, and only gives permission where doing so would not lead to prohibited training taking place;
  * puts all presentations and other training materials used at its Teacher training events on its website (or in a secure area of its website accessible to all Teachers for the qualification), clearly linked from the pages containing the relevant qualification specifications;
  * has on record clear terms of reference for the investigations it has undertaken into suspected or alleged breaches of confidentiality;
  * has on record a log of all allegations of breaches of confidentiality, including those that were not investigated, that it can cross-reference if new information is provided.

The awarding organisation:

  * takes all reasonable steps to ensure that resources designed to support the preparation of Learners which are prepared by current (and former) staff and third parties who have confidential assessment information in relation to that qualification do not compromise the confidentiality of assessments for that qualification;
  * trains relevant staff about how to protect confidential assessment information, including during the preparation of any resources designed to support the preparation of Learners, for a qualification in respect of which they have access to confidential assessment information;
  * requires all current (and former) staff and third parties who have confidential assessment information to notify the awarding organisation promptly of all instances in which they have been, or are currently, involved in the preparation of a resource designed to support the preparation of Learners for a qualification in respect of which they have access to confidential assessment information. This does not apply to the preparation of teaching resources or materials by a current (or former) third party exclusively for Learners that he or she teaches;
  * monitors assessments set by all current (and former) staff and third parties who are, or have been, involved in the preparation of a resource designed to support the preparation of Learners for assessments for the same qualification in respect of which they have confidential assessment information, to ensure that the confidentiality of those assessments has not been compromised by that resource. This does not apply to the preparation of teaching resources or materials by a current (or former) third party exclusively for Learners that he or she teaches.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * does not make sure its confidentiality policies and processes for staff and third parties are up to date and followed;
  * does not ensure that its conflict of interest records maintained under Condition A4.3 are up to date and contain details of all relevant conflicts in relation to staff and third parties who hold confidential assessment information;
  * provides Teacher training events where current (or former) staff or third parties are present in the audience who have had access to assessment information in relation to that qualification which is still confidential
  * provides material information about an assessment to Teachers at a training event that is additional to, or contradicts, its published information regarding the relevant qualification, without publishing that information as soon as reasonably practicable after the training event;
  * does not take all reasonable steps to establish whether its staff or third parties with access to confidential assessment material provide, or intend to provide, Teacher training relating to the qualification (whether privately or through another organisation);
  * has not properly considered evidence collected during an investigation into a suspected or alleged breach of confidentiality;
  * has not contacted relevant parties that are critical to an investigation into a suspected or alleged breach of confidentiality, or to the outcomes of that investigation;
  * has not kept records and documents relating to the breach of confidentiality and the investigation for an appropriate period
  * does not make sure its confidentiality policies and processes for staff and third parties are up to date and followed;
  * does not ensure that its conflict of interest records maintained under Condition A4.3 are up to date and contain details of all relevant conflicts in relation to staff and third parties who hold confidential assessment information;
  * provides Teacher training events where current (or former) staff or third parties are present in the audience who have had access to assessment information in relation to that qualification which is still confidential
  * provides material information about an assessment to Teachers at a training event that is additional to, or contradicts, its published information regarding the relevant qualification, without publishing that information as soon as reasonably practicable after the training event;
  * does not take all reasonable steps to establish whether its staff or third parties with access to confidential assessment material provide, or intend to provide, Teacher training relating to the qualification (whether privately or through another organisation);
  * has not properly considered evidence collected during an investigation into a suspected or alleged breach of confidentiality;
  * has not contacted relevant parties that are critical to an investigation into a suspected or alleged breach of confidentiality, or to the outcomes of that investigation;
  * has not kept records and documents relating to the breach of confidentiality and the investigation for an appropriate period.

## Condition G5 - Registration of Learners

  1. G5.1 An awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure that – 
    1. (a) each Learner taking a qualification which the awarding organisation makes available is registered in a way that permits the Learner to be clearly and uniquely identified, and
    2. (b) where the identity of a Learner has not previously been confirmed to the awarding organisation, or the Centre at which the assessment will take place, arrangements are in place to confirm the Learner’s identity.

There is currently no guidance on complying with this Condition

## Condition G6 - Arrangements for Reasonable Adjustments

  1. G6.1 An awarding organisation must, in accordance with Equalities Law, have in place clear arrangements for making Reasonable Adjustments in relation to qualifications which it makes available.

  1. G6.2 An awarding organisation must publish details of its arrangements for making Reasonable Adjustments, which must include details as to – 
    1. (a) how a Learner qualifies for a Reasonable Adjustment, and
    2. (b) what Reasonable Adjustment will be made.

### Guidance on Condition G6

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * is aware, and ensures that its staff are aware, of its responsibilities under Equalities Law (including maintaining an up-to-date knowledge of any changes);
  * engages with relevant stakeholders and representative groups to make sure its arrangements for Reasonable Adjustments meet its responsibilities on an ongoing basis;
  * considers the Reasonable Adjustments any disabled Learners might need;
  * where decisions about Reasonable Adjustments are delegated to Centres, ensures that, through its agreement with Centres, its arrangements for Reasonable Adjustments are delivered effectively;
  * makes information available to Centres and Learners about: 
    * entitlements under equalities law for disabled learners to request a Reasonable Adjustment and any restrictions that apply to this;
    * how to apply for a Reasonable Adjustment;
    * the evidence that should support the application for a Reasonable Adjustment;
    * the timelines for applying for a Reasonable Adjustment;
    * how the awarding organisation will decide whether a Learner should be given a particular Reasonable Adjustment;
    * how a Reasonable Adjustment will be made and any information, such as about equipment or time, the Centre needs to be able to do this; and
    * the process for Centres or Learners to appeal against the awarding organisation’s decision not to make a Reasonable Adjustment or a specific Reasonable Adjustment;
  * makes Reasonable Adjustments available so that disabled Learners can demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding;
  * considers each application or request for a Reasonable Adjustment on the basis of relevant information, or ensures that Centres do this where the decision has been delegated and: 
    * applies appropriate criteria, which are clear and consistent for determining each application;
    * where it rejects an application, provides a clear reason to the Centre or Learner and, where appropriate, suggests suitable alternative Reasonable Adjustments to those requested;
    * provides a process for the Centre or Learner to appeal against its decision;
    * keeps a record of the decisions it makes;
  * does not make, or allow Centres to make, a Reasonable Adjustment which: 
    * would prevent the qualification from providing a reliable indication of the extent to which a Learner has the knowledge, skills and understanding being measured;
    * would alter the knowledge, skills and understanding being measured as opposed to the way they are demonstrated; or
    * unfairly advantages or disadvantages any Learner or group of Learners, whether or not they have had a Reasonable Adjustment applied;
  * collects and analyses data on the number of requests for Reasonable Adjustments made and approved. This could include, for example, requests for each qualification or Centre;
  * collects and analyses information about complaints about Reasonable Adjustments or about decisions relating to them;
  * uses information, intelligence and data to identify and prevent potential misuse of Reasonable Adjustments by Centres and acts on any findings;
  * monitors each Centre’s application and use of Reasonable Adjustments and takes action where it is not making Reasonable Adjustments appropriately. The checks are regular and detailed enough to identify potential misuse of Reasonable Adjustments;
  * reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of its arrangements for Reasonable Adjustments, taking account of its own data and monitoring, information from Centres, Learners, Users of qualifications, Ofqual requirements and any other relevant guidance (for example from the Equality and Human Rights Commission) or case law. It uses this information to inform the design of its qualifications and makes necessary improvements in a timely and effective manner.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * fails to: 
    * make its approach to Reasonable Adjustments clear;
    * make appropriate Reasonable Adjustments available;
    * determine requests for Reasonable Adjustments in a fair, timely and consistent way;
    * consider requests for Reasonable Adjustments from Centres or Learners;
    * respond appropriately to complaints about its arrangements for Reasonable Adjustments;
    * ensure that where it delegates decisions on Reasonable Adjustments to Centres, the Centre follows its requirements;
  * does not make appropriate Reasonable Adjustments available that allow Learners to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding being measured;
  * does not understand or comply with its duties under Equalities Law to make Reasonable Adjustments;
  * makes a Reasonable Adjustment which is prohibited by Ofqual’s specifications under section 96 of the Equality Act 2010;
  * does not monitor, in a way that would enable it to identify any misuse, how centres are using Reasonable Adjustments;
  * approves, or allows Centres to approve, requests for Reasonable Adjustments which: 
    * are not based on sufficient evidence of how the Learner’s disability affects their ability to demonstrate the knowledge, skills and understanding being measured; or
    * unfairly advantage or disadvantage any Learner or group of Learners, whether or not they have had a Reasonable Adjustment applied;
  * rejects, or allows Centres to reject, requests for Reasonable Adjustments which meet the criteria it has set out for that Reasonable Adjustment to be applied, or does not provide a clear reason to the Centre or Learner where it rejects a request.

## Condition G7 - Arrangements for Special Consideration

  1. G7.1 An awarding organisation must have in place clear arrangements for Special Consideration to be given to Learners in relation to qualifications which it makes available.

  1. G7.2 An awarding organisation must publish details of its arrangements for giving Special Consideration, which must include details as to – 
    1. (a) how a Learner qualifies for Special Consideration, and
    2. (b) what Special Consideration will be given.

### Guidance on Condition G7

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * sets out clearly the types of Special Consideration, if any, that are appropriate for each qualification for Learners who have suffered an illness, injury or other event outside of their control. Special Consideration could include, but is not limited to: 
    * an adjustment to a Learner’s mark for a Learner whose performance in an assessment has been affected;
    * an adjustment to the arrangements for accessing an assessment for a Learner who is not disabled, but whose ability to access the assessment has been affected by an injury or illness;
    * carrying over the fee for an assessment that the Learner was unable to take to a later assessment opportunity;
  * has clear and consistent processes, which it communicates clearly to Centres or Learners, setting out: 
    * whether Special Consideration is available for a particular qualification or assessment and if so the types of Special Consideration that may be made;
    * the point in the assessment process at which Special Consideration will be applied;
    * where Special Consideration is available for Learners who have not completed all of the assessments, the minimum amount of assessment evidence the Learner must have completed before a qualification can be awarded;
    * the eligibility criteria and evidence requirements to support a request for Special Consideration;
    * the process and timelines for applying for Special Consideration;
    * how the eligibility criteria will be applied in each case to make a decision about whether to approve Special Consideration for a Learner;
    * the process for Centres or Learners to appeal against a decision not to grant Special Consideration;
  * ensures that in each case where it allows Special Consideration, it is applied appropriately and consistently, balancing the need to ensure that the qualification gives a reliable indication of the knowledge, skills and understanding being measured, with the need to ensure that as far as possible, Learners are not disadvantaged because of an illness, injury, or other event outside of their control;
  * takes into account the qualification’s objective when it decides the types of Special Consideration, if any, that should be available – types of Special Consideration available could include, but are not limited to: 
    * awarding additional marks where a Learner has been able to take an exam but where their performance has been affected by an illness, injury or other exceptional event outside of their control;
    * making arrangements to allow a Learner to access an exam, such as providing assistance to write in a written exam for a Learner who has suffered an injury which prevents them from writing;
    * allowing an alternative assessment opportunity for the Learner at a later date;
  * does not provide Special Consideration where this would alter or prevent the qualification from providing a reliable indication of the knowledge, skills and understanding being measured by the assessment objectives;
  * does not provide Special Consideration where this would unfairly advantage or disadvantage Learners;
  * ensures that Learners who have experienced an illness, injury or other event outside of their control, which will affect their ability to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding, are not unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged, as far as is possible, where Special Consideration is applied;
  * considers each application for Special Consideration and: 
    * applies clear and consistent criteria for determining each application, so that like cases are treated alike;
    * where issues affect a whole Centre or a number of Centres (for example flooding) considers the need for consistency in similar cases, including between other relevant awarding organisations;
    * where it rejects an application, provides a clear reason to the Centre or Learner;
    * provides a process for the Centre or Learner to appeal against its decision;
    * keeps a record of the decisions it makes;
  * collects and analyses data on the number of requests for Special Consideration made and approved. This could include, for example, requests by qualification, subject and Centre and the impact of any requests approved, for example changes to overall results;
  * uses data to identify and prevent potential misuse of Special Consideration by a Centre and acts on any findings;
  * has a process in place to monitor each Centre’s applications for Special Consideration and takes action where a Centre is not using the provision appropriately. The checks are sufficiently regular and detailed to identify misuse of Special Consideration;
  * reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of its arrangements for Special Consideration, taking account of its own monitoring, information from Centres, Learners, Users of qualifications and any Ofqual requirements.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * fails to: 
    * make its approach to Special Consideration clear, including, where relevant, being clear about where Special Consideration is not available;
    * determine requests for Special Consideration in a fair, timely and consistent way;
    * consider requests for Special Consideration, where it is allowed, from Centres or Learners;
    * respond appropriately to complaints about its arrangements for Special Consideration;
  * does not monitor, in a way that would enable it to identify any misuse, how Centres are using Special Consideration;
  * approves requests for Special Consideration which: 
    * are not based on sufficient evidence; or
    * unfairly advantage any Learner or group of Learners, whether or not they have had a Special Consideration applied;
  * rejects requests for Special Consideration which meet the criteria it has set out for that Special Consideration to be applied.

## Condition G8 - Completion of the assessment under the required conditions

  1. G8.1 An awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure that, in relation to qualifications which it makes available – 
    1. (a) evidence generated by a Learner in an assessment is generated by that Learner (or includes evidence generated by that Learner as a contribution to group work), and
    2. (b) where an assessment is required to be completed under specified conditions, Learners complete the assessment under those conditions (other than where any Reasonable Adjustments or Special Consideration require alternative conditions).

### Guidance on Condition G8

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * designs its qualifications so that: 
    * the conditions under which assessments or tasks must be completed are able to be delivered by Centres and Assessors;
    * as far as is possible, the awarding organisation, Centres or Assessors can determine whether work has been produced by the Learner being assessed;
  * considers the possible risks to assessments being completed under the specified conditions or to being able to authenticate Learners’ work and designs assessments (for each assessment or subject) and tasks to mitigate these risks;
  * sets clear requirements for the conditions under which Learners must complete the assessment and communicates these clearly to Centres, ensuring appropriate guidance and support (which could include training) is provided, including for relevant Centre staff. These could include, but are not limited to, requirements for: 
    * the resources or materials required for Learners to complete the assessment;
    * its expectations of Centres and their staff in relation to ensuring the assessment is completed under the required conditions and that work is completed by the Learner for whom it is submitted;
    * conducting the assessment, including where appropriate, the environment/location and conditions under which it must be completed;
    * any relevant administrative and security arrangements, such as restrictions on the timing of access to assessment materials;
    * any invigilation, supervision or verification arrangements;
    * the way in which any practical assessments must be conducted;
    * any restriction on the number of occasions on which the assessment can be undertaken;
    * the way in which any group work is assessed and how the knowledge and skills of each individual Learner should be identified;
    * the extent, if any, to which Learners can redraft or refine their work and benefit from Centre feedback;
    * how it will enforce its requirements, check that Centres follow them and the possible sanctions if they do not;
  * where Centres set and deliver assessments, ensures that Centres have in place appropriate arrangements to meet the awarding organisation’s requirements;
  * takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the Learner has produced the work being assessed. These could include, but are not limited to: 
    * requiring Centres to identify Learners using methods such as photographic identification, signatures or other unique identifiers to confirm that the Learner is who they say they are;
    * requiring declarations that the work has been produced by the Learner for whom it is being submitted, for example a statement by the Learner, and/or the Centre and/or an Assessor, depending on the nature of the assessment;
    * determining the contribution made by individual Learners to group tasks and assessments;
    * making arrangements to ensure that work submitted by private/external candidates has been produced by the Learner;
    * ensuring relevant Centre and awarding organisation staff are trained on how to identify where a Learner’s work may not be their own and what to do where this is the case;
  * checks that the assessment is completed under the required conditions and that Learners have produced the work being assessed, for example by carrying out regular checks, including some unannounced, on Centres delivering assessments;
  * investigates cases where it believes its requirements are not being met and takes appropriate action where it finds evidence that this is the case. The actions it takes, combined with its monitoring arrangements, are an effective incentive for Centres to comply with their obligations;
  * keeps its processes for ensuring the assessment is completed under the required conditions and that work is produced by the Learner under review. It reviews and acts on feedback from its own monitoring, from Centres, from Ofqual and other relevant sources to improve its arrangements as necessary.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * does not take appropriate steps during the design of the qualification to remove or reduce risks that the assessment is not completed under the required conditions or that Learners’ work cannot be authenticated;
  * does not set, or make available to Centres, clear requirements setting out: 
    * the conditions under which assessments must be completed;
    * arrangements for ensuring and confirming that the work being assessed is produced by the Learner;
  * sets requirements which are not manageable for Centres;
  * does not provide appropriate training or support to Centres on its requirements;
  * sets assessments which require group work where it is not possible to determine the contribution of each individual Learner;
  * credits, or allows Centres to credit, Learners for an assessment for which it cannot be satisfactorily verified that the work has been produced by that Learner;
  * allows an assessment to be taken under conditions other than those it has specified, except where a Reasonable Adjustment or Special Consideration applies;
  * does not effectively monitor, to enable it to identify where Centres are not meeting its requirements;
  * does not promptly investigate or take appropriate, effective and consistent action where there is evidence that its requirements are not being met;
  * does not make appropriate changes or improvements to its requirements where it has identified issues with its arrangements.

## Condition G9 - Delivering the assessment

  1. G9.1 An awarding organisation must ensure that every assessment for a qualification that it makes available is delivered effectively and efficiently.

  1. G9.2 An awarding organisation must ensure that, on delivery of every assessment for a qualification that it makes available, the assessment: 
    1. (a) is fit for purpose,
    2. (b) permits Reasonable Adjustments to be made, while minimising the need for them,
    3. (c) allows each Learner to generate evidence which can be Authenticated,
    4. (d) allows each specified level of attainment detailed in the specification to be reached by a Learner who has attained the required level of knowledge, skills and understanding, and
    5. (e) allows Assessors to be able to differentiate accurately and consistently between a range of attainments by Learners.

  1. G9.3 An awarding organisation must ensure that, on delivery of every assessment for a qualification that it makes available, the content of the assessment: 
    1. (a) is fit for purpose,
    2. (b) is appropriate for the method of assessment chosen, and
    3. (c) is consistent with the specification for that qualification.

### Guidance on Condition G9

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * clearly sets out how its assessments must be delivered to ensure that they are valid and delivered effectively and efficiently and communicates its requirements clearly to Centres;
  * ensures that, as far as is possible, all assessments are delivered consistently within and across Centres and in accordance with its requirements, for example by: 
    * providing consistent guidance and support (which could include training) for Centres delivering assessments and tasks;
    * providing guidance to Centres about the conditions that are required to ensure that Learners have opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding under appropriate conditions, including, where appropriate, in the workplace;
  * ensures that all assessments delivered: 
    * include content that covers the knowledge, skills and understanding in the specification to the extent required for a particular assessment;
    * use assessment arrangements which deliver valid assessments, whilst ensuring as far as is possible that equipment or materials required are reasonably obtainable for Centres;
    * enable Learners to demonstrate the extent to which they have the knowledge, skills and understanding required by the qualification – for graded qualifications, this should be for the full range of Learners targeted;
    * enable the awarding organisation to differentiate effectively between Learners (that is, on the basis of the knowledge, skills and understanding being assessed) – for graded qualifications this should be across the range of attainment targeted by the assessment;
    * award marks or credits that are representative of the demands of the questions/tasks;
    * can be consistently applied by Assessors, moderators and verifiers to ensure accurate and consistent judgements are made about the attainment of Learners;
  * monitors the way assessments are delivered and the use of appropriate safeguards to identify and authenticate each Learner’s work;
  * only uses group assessments where it is an effective way to assess the skills being measured and where the contribution of each Learner can be identified and authenticated;
  * monitors the delivery of assessments to ensure its requirements are being met, for example by carrying out regular checks on Centres’ practices, and takes action where this is not the case;
  * keeps its arrangements for delivering assessments under review, making changes to its arrangements where necessary to address any issues.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

  * delivers assessments, or permits Centres to deliver assessments, which cannot be delivered efficiently or effectively, for example because: 
    * procedures or assessments add unnecessary costs (including those which are not directly incurred) to Centres or Learners;
    * resources and equipment required are not reasonably obtainable for Centres;
    * insufficient information is provided to Centres about the requirements they have to meet;
    * there is insufficient time available for Centres to deliver assessments or tasks to all Learners in line with the awarding organisation’s requirements;
  * uses assessment types in which the work of individual Learners cannot be authenticated, for example: 
    * setting assessments or tasks which are completed without supervision and without suitable alternative safeguards in place;
    * setting group tasks where the contribution of individual Learners cannot be distinguished;
  * delivers assessments which do not allow it to measure the extent to which Learners have the knowledge, skills and understanding required by the qualification or which do not differentiate validly between the full range of attainment by Learners;
  * delivers assessments which discriminate between Learners on the basis of factors other than the knowledge, skills and understanding being measured by the qualification, for example: 
    * because the language or vocabulary used in an assessment prevents a Learner understanding what is being assessed;
    * because a Learner who is familiar with the context in which an assessment task is set, but which is unrelated to the knowledge and skills being assessed, will be advantaged over a Learner who is unfamiliar with that context.

## Guidance on safeguarding confidentiality where Teachers are involved in
developing assessments

### Introduction

Many awarding organisations use Teachers in the development of assessments,
and there can be clear benefits to doing so. Experienced Teachers have
detailed subject knowledge and understand how Learners are likely to respond
to questions. It requires skill and experience to develop successful exam
papers and other forms of assessment. Assessments must be comprehensible to
Learners while allowing appropriate differentiation between them. Assessments
must not be too predictable, but neither must they stray from what has been
taught. They must be capable of being completed within the allocated time and
must be of the same level of demand whenever they are taken.

However, we expect awarding organisations to be alive to the risks to
confidentiality to which the use of practising Teachers gives rise, and to use
appropriate safeguards to ensure compliance with the Conditions.

This guidance identifies a number of Conditions that place obligations on
awarding organisations which are relevant to this issue. It also outlines some
of the factors that will be relevant in an awarding organisation’s analysis of
the strength of the safeguards it needs and gives some examples of the types
of safeguards that might be used.

There is no ‘one size fits all approach’ to mitigating the risks of a Teacher
misusing confidential information about assessments. Each awarding
organisation must use safeguards that are appropriate for each of its
qualifications. Responsibility for taking a suitably robust approach to
complying with the Conditions sits with each awarding organisation, having had
regard to this statutory guidance, as well as the specific guidance in
relation to the relevant Conditions.

In the guidance below ‘confidential assessment information’ refers to both the
contents of assessment materials, and information about the assessment, in
relation to which confidentiality must be maintained under Condition G4.1.

### What requirements must an awarding organisation meet?

The Conditions below are especially relevant to the risks around the
involvement of Teachers in the development of assessments.

  * Condition A4.2 requires an awarding organisation to identify and monitor all current and reasonably foreseeable conflicts of interest (as defined in Condition A4.1) that relate to it. This will include identifying any relevant teaching roles held by Teachers involved in the development of assessments, and monitoring any such conflict.
  * Condition A4.4 requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps to ensure that no conflict of interest that relates to it has an Adverse Effect. An awarding organisation is thus required to do everything that it can to ensure that no Teacher involved in developing assessments breaches confidentiality. Where an Adverse Effect does occur, Condition A4.5 requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps to mitigate that effect as far as possible and correct it.
  * Condition A6.1 requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps to identify the risk of occurrence of any incident that could have an Adverse Effect. This will include an awarding organisation’s assessment of risk in relation to breaches of confidentiality by Teachers involved in assessment development. Condition A6.2 requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps to prevent any such incident from occurring and prevent (or if it cannot be prevented, mitigate) any Adverse Effect that the incident would have if it occurred.
  * Where an incident occurs which could have an Adverse Effect, Condition A7.1 requires an awarding organisation to promptly take all reasonable steps to prevent the Adverse Effect – or, where it occurs, to mitigate and correct it as far as possible and give priority to making sure the assessments accurately differentiate between Learners.
  * Condition A8.1 requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps to prevent the occurrence of malpractice in the development, delivery or award of qualifications. A deliberate breach of confidentiality in relation to assessments will almost certainly constitute malpractice. Where any such malpractice is reasonably suspected or alleged, Condition A8.2 requires an awarding organisation to investigate it.
  * Where malpractice is established, Condition A8.6 requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps to prevent it from reoccurring and to take proportionate action against those responsible, or seek the cooperation of third parties in taking such action.
  * Where an awarding organisation arranges for a third party – such as a Teacher – to undertake any part of qualification development on its behalf, Condition C1.1 requires the awarding organisation to (i) ensure that those arrangements enable the awarding organisation to comply with the Conditions, and (ii) to monitor and enforce those arrangements where necessary to ensure compliance with the Conditions.
  * Condition G4.1 requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of the content of, or information about, assessment materials where this is required to ensure the qualification reflects an accurate measure of attainment. In particular, Condition G4.5(b) requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps to ensure that no Teacher or other third party involved in the development of assessments breaches, or offers to breach, such confidentiality.

### Factors in deciding what safeguards are appropriate

Each awarding organisation must use safeguards that are appropriate for each
of its qualifications.

In determining the package of safeguards that would be appropriate, we expect
an awarding organisation to consider all relevant factors. In particular, we
expect an awarding organisation to consider the following:

  * The nature and amount of confidential assessment information held by a Teacher – We will expect that the more confidential assessment information that a Teacher has about an assessment – or the greater the effect that its disclosure would have on the fitness for purpose of the assessment – the stronger the package of safeguards an awarding organisation will need to use to meet the requirements of the Conditions.
  * The Teacher’s role in delivering qualifications – We expect that the more directly a Teacher is involved with delivering the qualification for which he or she holds confidential assessment information, the stronger the package of safeguards that will be needed. A stronger package of safeguards should be used for a Teacher currently involved in teaching the relevant qualification, including as a private tutor, than for a Teacher who teaches an alternative qualification (such as one offered by a different awarding organisation), or who is no longer actively teaching.
  * Potential pressures on Teachers to misuse confidential assessment information – We expect that an awarding organisation will take stronger steps to prevent a Teacher inappropriately using confidential assessment information about a qualification used for school or college accountability purposes, or which is particularly high stakes because it directly affects a Learner’s progression options or life chances. This will include, in particular, qualifications that are used for progression to higher education, or which confer a licence to practise.
  * The impact if confidential assessment information is misused – In considering what safeguards to put in place, we expect an awarding organisation to consider the ease with which it could replace assessment materials, or Learners could re-take an assessment, should a Teacher be found to have made inappropriate use of confidential assessment information.

For example, it is likely to be more difficult for an awarding organisation to
mitigate the impact of an inappropriate disclosure in relation to a
qualification that is assessed once annually, is taken by large numbers, and
for which there is a pre-determined results date (such as GCSEs and A levels)
than for a qualification for which there are regular assessment opportunities.

Some qualifications will be awarded on the basis of one assessment only,
whereas for others, a number of assessments will contribute to the final
result. In qualifications for which there are multiple assessments, if one
assessment is compromised, a result might be awarded based on a Learner’s
performance in the other assessments. The number of assessments that
contribute towards a qualification is therefore a further factor for an
awarding organisation to consider when determining the ease with which it
could mitigate the impact of a breach of confidentiality.

### Potential safeguards

Below are some examples of the potential safeguards that an awarding
organisation may use to prevent the disclosure of confidential assessment
information or to limit any Adverse Effect resulting from such a disclosure.
The examples we provide relate to:

  * assessment development and design;
  * support for Teachers and Centres; and
  * detection and deterrence.

Each awarding organisation must consider what (if any) safeguards will be
required in relation to each of its qualifications, taking into account all
relevant factors, including those outlined in the previous section.

We expect an awarding organisation to consider the appropriate balance between
up-front measures to prevent and (if necessary) mitigate the disclosure of
confidential assessment information, and end-point measures which allow it
quickly to identify and mitigate any disclosure that takes place.

#### Assessment development and design

(a) Teachers are not involved in developing confidential assessment materials
– The surest way for an awarding organisation to guard against Teachers
inappropriately using confidential assessment information is to make sure no
Teachers have such information. An awarding organisation could choose to keep
its assessment production process entirely in-house and not contract services
from currently employed Teachers. It could secure any necessary Teacher
insights and expertise from recently retired Teachers or Teachers who are
taking a break from teaching.

(b) Teachers involved with developing confidential assessment materials cannot
teach the qualification – An awarding organisation might stipulate that any
Teachers it engages to develop confidential assessment materials must not
themselves teach the qualification for which those materials would be used,
while those materials remained confidential. Its contractual provisions would
need to address the risks of disclosure to teaching colleagues and address the
opportunities for the Teacher to work as a private tutor, for example.

While the above two approaches might work well for some qualifications, an
awarding organisation would need to balance their use against the different
risks to which they could give rise, including to the quality of the
assessments developed. In relation to the second example, Teachers might not
wish to develop assessments for qualifications they are not allowed to teach.
Such a prohibition could limit their ability to change jobs and the options of
their Centre to change awarding organisation.

(c) No serving Teacher knows whether or when the assessment materials they
have developed or seen will be used – An awarding organisation might
commission Teachers to write whole or parts of assessments, but the decision
on whether or when the materials would be used would be tightly controlled and
not be known to any Teacher. The use of a question bank, or question paper
bank, may achieve the necessary degree of uncertainty, although consideration
would need to be given to the size of the question bank and the frequency with
which it is updated (and it would still need to be made clear to Teachers that
information in relation to each question or task within the bank was
confidential). We will view each individual item in a bank as confidential.
However, the number of items in the bank, and the structure of the relevant
assessment, will be relevant to the risks arising from any breach of
confidentiality in relation to an individual item, and how easily the Adverse
Effect arising from any such breach can be mitigated.

The form and degree of unpredictability needed to make this approach an
effective safeguard will vary by qualification. An awarding organisation
should consider the number and the nature of the assessment tasks/questions,
whether the tasks/questions would be memorable if seen in advance, and whether
a Learner who had prior information about the task/question would likely be
advantaged over others.

For qualifications such as GCSEs, A levels and the main alternatives, the
stakes of the qualification, for both Learners and Centres, are sufficiently
high that we will normally expect an awarding organisation to manage its
assessment development in such a way so no Teacher of the relevant
qualification knows with certainty the content of any specific assessment.
Where it does not do so, we will expect an awarding organisation to be able to
offer a compelling justification for any alternative approach.

(d) No serving teacher is involved with developing all of the assessments for
any one qualification – Where the confidentiality of one assessment has been
compromised by a Teacher, an awarding organisation might disregard the
affected Learners’ performance in that assessment and estimate their overall
mark based on their performance in the other assessments for the
qualification, relative to the performance of other Learners who completed all
of the assessments (an ‘assessed result’). This will only be possible where
there is more than one assessment for the qualification, and not all of those
assessments have been compromised by the Teacher’s actions.

An awarding organisation that allows Teachers to develop assessments for
qualifications they also teach might ensure that no such Teacher sees all the
assessments to be taken by a Learner for that qualification (for example, both
exam papers). This would limit the impact, including on Learners, of a Teacher
inappropriately using confidential assessment information. It could also
assist with the awarding organisation’s monitoring activities as it would
allow the awarding organisation to consider whether Learners performed better
than expected in the assessment their Teacher had developed or otherwise seen,
relative to their performance in their other assessments.

#### Support for Teachers and Centres

The types of support an awarding organisation might give to a Teacher who
holds confidential assessment information include:

  * clear contractual arrangements setting out the Teacher’s obligations with respect to confidential assessment information and any limitations on other roles the Teacher could undertake while information he or she held remained confidential,
  * providing training and advice to the Teacher in relation to maintaining confidentiality of assessment materials and information,
  * having direct contact with the Teacher’s Centre to emphasise the importance of ethical practice, the potential consequences of wrong-doing and the support the Centre might provide the Teacher to avoid deliberately or sub-consciously using the information they hold in an inappropriate way, and
  * requiring annual declarations from the Teacher that he or she understands and will at all times comply with their obligations to protect confidential assessment information.

Where a Teacher has access to confidential assessment information, we will
expect an awarding organisation’s contract with that Teacher to at least
provide for termination in the event of any deliberate disclosure of such
information.

#### Detection and deterrence

An awarding organisation is required to actively monitor all conflicts of
interest that apply to it (Condition A4.2), as well as its contractual
arrangements (Condition C1.1(b)). It is also required to take all reasonable
steps to prevent:

  * any conflict of interest having an Adverse Effect (Condition A4.4),
  * the occurrence of any incident that could have an Adverse Effect (Condition A6.2(a)),
  * any malpractice in relation to the development and award of qualifications (Condition A8.1), and
  * any breach of confidentiality in relation to confidential assessment information (Condition G4.1).

A Teacher who holds confidential assessment information may be deterred from
using that information inappropriately if he or she knows that such use is
likely to be detected. We will therefore expect an awarding organisation to
consider whether, in view of the risks it faces in relation to a particular
qualification, the transparent use of any monitoring procedures will be a
reasonable step to take to meet the requirements of the above Conditions.

We will expect awarding organisations to undertake some level of monitoring in
relation to high stakes qualifications in relation to which Teachers hold
confidential assessment information. We also expect them to investigate
thoroughly any allegations or evidence of malpractice.

The monitoring undertaken by an awarding organisation may be shaped by the
safeguards that it has put in place at the development stage. For example,
more robust upfront safeguards may mean that less rigorous monitoring is
required. However, an awarding organisation must always be alive to the risk
of a breach of confidentiality – no matter how robust its upfront safeguards –
and the need to swiftly identify and deal with any breach that occurs.

Some examples of the types of monitoring and investigation that an awarding
organisation could undertake are as follows:

  * reviewing the evidence generated in the relevant assessment by Learners whose Teacher had confidential assessment information to look for any unusual patterns in their responses;
  * in response to allegations of a breach of confidentiality by a Teacher, looks for signs in their teaching plans, teaching materials and formative assessments that they had inappropriately narrowed their teaching or disclosed confidential information;
  * monitoring social media to look for signs that confidential assessment information has been disclosed; and
  * undertaking statistical monitoring to look for unusual results or patterns of results in Centres where Teachers with confidential assessment information are teaching.

In each case an awarding organisation should consider whether a particular
type of monitoring or investigation will yield reliable information, whether
in isolation or as part of a wider range of evidence.

### Examples

We have set out above some general indications as to when we will expect to
see stronger safeguards depending on the risks associated with a particular
qualification.

The following examples illustrate the different safeguards that an awarding
organisation may choose to put in place for qualifications with different risk
profiles. These examples are not intended to mandate any particular approach
in relation to any particular type of qualification but rather – when read
together with the sections above – to aid an awarding organisation’s own
consideration of how best to comply with the Conditions.

#### Example 1

The qualification and associated risks | One possible approach  
---|---  
A high stakes qualification used for school accountability purposes, taken by
c. 250,000 Learners annually and used to support progression to employment or
higher education.  
  
The assessments comprise two unseen written exam papers, each containing six
questions from which Learners must attempt three questions.  
  
The nature and number of questions on each paper makes them memorable and, if
known in advance, teaching and learning could be narrowed.  
  
The impact of a breach would be high, including because of the numbers of Learners who could be affected and the damage to public confidence. | The awarding organisation considers that Teacher input to developing the assessment materials will enhance the quality of the assessments and, because risks can be managed as set out below, it decides to retain that input.  
  
In light of the potential impact of any breach of confidentiality, and the
opportunities to narrow teaching and learning if the exam questions are known
in advance, the awarding organisation:  
(a) commissions three Teachers to each write questions on specific aspects of
the curriculum and requires them to document the assessment objectives and
their relative weightings that will be assessed for each question, for use
when the exam paper is put together;  
(b) ensures that no one Teacher knows which of his or her questions will be
used in any particular exam paper in any particular assessment series and does
not see the questions developed by the other Teachers;  
(c) identifies a permanent member of staff, advised by a recently retired
Teacher of the qualification, to select the questions to be used in the two
exam papers for any assessment series.  
(d) sets out in their contracts the Teachers’ obligations with regard to the
confidential materials, and provides for the termination of the contract in
the event of disclosure of confidential assessment information by the Teacher;  
(e) makes sure each Teacher’s head of Centre knows the role the Teacher has
played and that he or she will not know whether or when the questions they
have written will be used; and  
(f) reviews the Learners’ scripts of at least one of the Teachers each year to
look for unusual patterns of responses.  
  
#### Example 2

The qualification and associated risks | One possible approach  
---|---  
A high stakes qualification used for school accountability purposes, taken by
c.100,000 Learners annually and used to support progression to employment or
higher education.  
  
The assessments comprise three unseen written exam papers, each covering
different aspects of the curriculum. Learners must attempt all questions on
each paper.  
  
The nature and number of questions on each paper means they are not
particularly memorable. The nature of both the subject content and of the exam
questions means that, even if the questions were known in advance, teaching
and learning the whole of the curriculum would be needed to secure a good
mark.  
  
The impact of a breach would be high, including because of the numbers of Learners who could be affected and the damage to public confidence. | The awarding organisation has had difficulties recruiting people with appropriate subject and assessment expertise to develop the assessments. In the longer term it commits to commissioning the writing of multiple papers so no Teacher currently teaching the qualification who develops assessments knows if or when any particular assessment will be used.   
  
In the short term it is concerned the extra workload of such an approach would
deter anyone considering applying for an examiner role. It therefore engages
two Teachers who currently teach the qualification to each write one of the
papers. The third paper is written by a full-time employee who, until
recently, had taught the specific aspects of the curriculum assessed by that
paper. Neither of the Teachers sees the two papers that they have not written,
only the employee sees all three.  
  
The awarding organisation reviews the exam scripts of the Learners who were
taught by the two Teachers to look for any unusual patterns of response. It
also undertakes a statistical analysis to determine whether the Learners’
performance in the paper their Teacher had developed was out of line with
their performance in the other papers, relative to the performance of all
Learners taking the qualification. It interviews the Teacher and the Learners,
where appropriate, to understand the reasons for any unusual patterns.  
  
Each Teacher’s contract with the awarding organisation sets out the Teacher’s
obligations with regard to the confidential assessment information, and
provides for the termination of the contract in the event of disclosure of
such information by the Teacher.  
The awarding organisation makes sure each Teacher’s head of Centre knows the
role they have played and advises them of the steps it will take to detect any
inappropriate use of the information held by the Teacher.  
  
#### Example 3

The qualification and associated risks | One possible approach  
---|---  
A high stakes qualification for the Learner and for those who rely on the
qualification as an indication of competence to practise.  
  
Assessment is by observation of the Learner undertaking a predetermined set of
tasks which are well known and will have been practised extensively before
undertaking the assessment.  
  
The nature of the assessment is intentionally highly predictable, as the Learners are assessed on their competence in performing a known set of tasks. | As Learners know they will be assessed on their full range of skills, and the assessments are intentionally predictable, the awarding organisation does not consider it necessary to limit who can write the tasks or to use particular safeguards where practitioners who write the tasks also employ people who are preparing for the assessments. It does not therefore adopt any additional safeguards.

    2. (b) the awarding organisation reasonably concludes that there is a material inconsistency between the Level of Demand of two optional tasks or assessments, and
    3. (c) it is likely that the inconsistency will prejudice a group of Learners,
  2. the awarding organisation must make a reasonable alteration to the criteria against which Learners’ performance will be differentiated for the optional task or assessment so as to prevent that prejudice from occurring.

  1. H1.3 Where such a reasonable alteration is made for an optional task or assessment, an awarding organisation must ensure that the alteration is applied uniformly in the marking of every task or assessment in relation to which a Learner has taken that option.

  1. H2.1 Where evidence generated by a Learner in an assessment for a qualification made available by an awarding organisation is marked by a Centre, the awarding organisation must have in place clear and effective arrangements to undertake Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny in respect of the assessment.

  1. H2.2 An awarding organisation must ensure that in respect of any Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny which it undertakes it complies with – 
    1. (a) any requirements, and has regard to any guidance, which may be published by Ofqual and revised from time to time, and
    2. (b) any requirements which Ofqual has communicated to it in writing.

### Moderation

  1. H2.3 An awarding organisation’s arrangements in respect of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny – 
    1. (a) must include Moderation – 
      1. (i) of an assessment for a qualification specified in a list which may be published by Ofqual and revised from time to time, and
      2. (ii) in circumstances which Ofqual has communicated to the awarding organisation in writing, and
    2. (b) in all other cases, may include Moderation.

  1. H2.4 An awarding organisation must ensure that any Moderation which it undertakes allows it effectively to determine whether or not – 
    1. (a) the assessment remains fit for purpose, and
    2. (b) the criteria against which Learners’ performance is differentiated are being applied accurately and consistently by Assessors in different Centres, regardless of the identity of the Assessor, Learner, or Centre.

  1. H2.5 An awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) ensure that any such Moderation which it undertakes ensures that it is able to make any necessary changes to a Centre’s marking of evidence generated by a Learner in an assessment, and
    2. (b) make such a change wherever it considers it necessary in order to ensure that the assessment remains fit for purpose or that the criteria against which Learners’ performance is differentiated are being applied accurately and consistently.

###  Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy

  1. H2.6 In respect of each qualification which it makes available, or proposes to make available, where evidence generated by a Learner is marked by a Centre an awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) establish and maintain a Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy for that qualification,
    2. (b) ensure that its strategy complies with any requirements which may be published by Ofqual and revised from time to time, and
    3. (c) have regard to any guidance in relation to Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategies which may be published by Ofqual and revised from time to time.

  1. H2.7 In particular, an awarding organisation must ensure that the Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy for a qualification sets out how the awarding organisation intends to secure, on an ongoing basis, compliance with Conditions H2.1 to H2.5 in respect of the assessments for that qualification.

  1. H2.8 An awarding organisation must ensure that all Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny which it undertakes complies with its strategy established under this Condition.

  1. H2.9 An awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) keep under review its Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy, and revise it where necessary, so as to satisfy itself that the strategy meets at all times the requirements of Conditions H2.6 and H2.7,
    2. (b) when requested to do so by Ofqual in writing, promptly submit to Ofqual that strategy, and
    3. (c) review that strategy promptly upon receiving a request from Ofqual to do so, and subsequently ensure that its strategy complies with any requirements that Ofqual has communicated to it in writing.

  1. H2.10 An awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) upon receiving a request from Ofqual to do so, demonstrate to Ofqual’s satisfaction that it has complied with its Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy in respect of any particular assessment, or provide an explanation to Ofqual as to why it has not so complied, and
    2. (b) give effect to any recommendation that Ofqual may make in respect of its compliance with its Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy.

  * Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny other than moderation
  * Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny for moderated assessments
  * Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategies

## Condition H3 - Monitoring the specified levels of attainment for a
qualification

  1. H3.1 Before setting a specified level of attainment for a qualification which it makes available, an awarding organisation must review the specified levels of attainment set for – 
    1. (a) the qualification previously,
    2. (b) similar qualifications it makes available, and
    3. (c) similar qualifications made available by other awarding organisations,
  2. and must use the results of this monitoring to ensure that the specified level of attainment it sets for the qualification will promote consistency in measuring the levels of attainment of Learners over time and between similar qualifications.

There is currently no guidance on complying with this Condition

## Condition H4 - Adjudication by Ofqual of specified levels of attainment for
a qualification

  1. H4.1 Where – 
    1. (a) an awarding organisation makes available a qualification,
    2. (b) at least one other awarding organisation makes available a qualification which is viewed by the generality of Users of qualifications as being a direct equivalent to that qualification
    3. (c) each awarding organisation sets the specified level or levels of attainment for the equivalent qualification that they respectively make available,
    4. (d) Ofqual considers that a specified level of attainment set by an awarding organisation prevents the equivalent qualifications from indicating a consistent level of attainment (including, where Ofqual considers appropriate, over time), and
    5. (e) Ofqual specifies to an awarding organisation, in writing, requirements in relation to a specified level of attainment for the qualification which it makes available (either for a particular assessment cycle or during a particular time period),
  2. any awarding organisation to which Ofqual has specified such requirements must ensure that, before the qualification is awarded for that assessment cycle or during that time period, the specified level of attainment for the qualification complies with those requirements.

There is currently no guidance on complying with this Condition

## Condition H5 - Results for a qualification must be based on sufficient
evidence

  1. H5.1 An awarding organisation must ensure that the result of each assessment taken by a Learner in relation to a qualification which the awarding organisation makes available reflects the level of attainment demonstrated by that Learner in the assessment.

  1. H5.2 An awarding organisation must ensure that – 
    1. (a) the marking of an assessment in relation to, and
    2. (b) the awarding of,
  2. a qualification which it makes available takes into account all admissible evidence generated by a Learner as part of that assessment.

  1. H5.3 Where an awarding organisation sets a rule as to the quantity or type of evidence generated by Learners which will be admissible in an assessment, it must ensure that – 
    1. (a) the assessment makes the rule clear, and
    2. (b) the rule is applied to all Learners taking the assessment (other than where any Reasonable Adjustments or Special Consideration require it to be altered).

  1. H5.4 Where an awarding organisation sets a rule as to how the final mark for a qualification will be calculated from marks for different assessments, it must ensure that – 
    1. (a) the qualification makes the rule clear, and
    2. (b) the rule is applied to all Learners taking the qualification (other than where any Reasonable Adjustments or Special Consideration require it to be altered).

There is currently no guidance on complying with these Conditions

## Condition H6 - Issuing results

  1. H6.1 An awarding organisation must, in relation to any qualification which it makes available – 
    1. (a) issue results for all units and qualifications,
    2. (b) publish expected dates or timescales for the issue of those results,
    3. (c) issue results which are clear and readily capable of being understood by Users of qualifications
    4. (d) issue results which accurately and completely reflect the marking of assessments (including the outcome of any Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny and any other quality assurance process),
    5. (e) ensure that the issue of results is timely, and
    6. (f) take all reasonable steps to meet any date or timescale it has published for the issue of results.

  1. H6.2 An awarding organisation must comply with any notice in writing issued by Ofqual under this condition requiring it to refrain from issuing results for a qualification or qualifications – 
    1. (a) until such date as Ofqual might specify; and
    2. (b) until it has complied with such requirements as Ofqual might specify.

### Correcting results

  1. H6.3 Where an awarding organisation discovers that any result which it has issued is incorrect it must – 
    1. (a) correct that result where the error is discovered through the application of an appeals process,
    2. (b) in all other cases – 
      1. (i) consider whether it is appropriate to correct that result, having regard to any guidance on making changes to incorrect results published by Ofqual and revised from time to time, and
      2. (ii) correct that result where it considers it appropriate to do so.

You may find it helpful to read our guidance on making changes to incorrect
results

## List of assessments that must be Moderated

Condition H2.3(a)(i) allows us to specify assessments which must be subject to
Moderation by an awarding organisation.

We set out below our list for the purposes of Condition H2.3(a)(i).

  1. Except where Condition H2 is disapplied by a Subject Level Condition, an awarding organisation must ensure that all assessments for the following qualifications are subject to Moderation where evidence generated by a Learner is marked by a Centre – 
    1. (a) Qualifications to which either the GCSE (9 to 1) Qualification Level Conditions or the GCSE (A* to G) Qualification Level Conditions apply,
    2. (b) Qualifications to which either the GCE Qualification Level Conditions or the Pre-reform GCE Qualification Level Conditions apply.
    3. (c) Qualifications to which the Qualification Level Conditions for Technical Qualifications apply.
    4. (d) Qualifications to which the Project Qualification Level Conditions apply.
    5. (e) Qualifications to which the Performance Table Qualification Qualification Level Conditions apply.

##  Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny requirements

Condition H2.2(a) allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation
to the Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny undertaken by an awarding
organisation.

We set out below our requirements for the purposes of Condition H2.2(a).

These requirements do not apply to assessments that are Moderated.

An awarding organisation must comply with these requirements in respect of
each assessment which is not subject to Moderation where evidence generated by
a Learner is marked by a Centre. This means that where, for example, a
qualification has two assessments marked by Centres, one of which is subject
to Moderation (either because it has been specified by Ofqual under Condition
H2.3(a) or the awarding organisation has chosen to Moderate it under Condition
H2.3(b)), the other assessment must be subject to Centre Assessment Standards
Scrutiny in line with the requirements below.

### Minimum requirements

  1. An awarding organisation must ensure that, through its Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny, it takes all reasonable steps effectively to determine whether or not – 
    1. (a) an assessment remains, or was, fit for purpose, and
    2. (b) the criteria against which Learners’ performance is differentiated are being, or were, applied accurately and consistently by Assessors in different Centres, regardless of the identity of the Assessor, Learner, or Centre.

An awarding organisation must ensure that the arrangements which it has in
place to undertake Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny meet at least the
following minimum requirements –

Annual activities  
---  
Annual activities in respect of each Centre, undertaken either face-to-face or
remotely, including –  
  
(a) consideration of marking undertaken by the Centre since the last such
scrutiny,  
(b) where appropriate, observation of one or more assessments being taken, and  
(c) where appropriate, observation of the marking by the Centre of the
assessments observed under (b).  
Sampling  
---  
An awarding organisation must ensure that marking undertaken by the Centre in
respect of all Components for a qualification is subject to scrutiny, although
each Component does not need to be the subject of scrutiny every year.  
An awarding organisation must ensure that it scrutinises an appropriate sample
of marking by the Centre –  
(a) In considering what sample size is appropriate the awarding organisation
must have regard to –  
(i) any specific risks that relate to that Centre, assessment or
qualification,  
(ii) the number of Learners registered for the qualification at the Centre,  
(iii) the range of attainments demonstrated by those Learners,  
(iv) the number of Assessors at the Centre involved in marking the relevant
assessment, and  
(v) the number of persons involved in internal quality assurance in relation
to marking at the Centre.  
(b) Where it considers it necessary in light of any risks that it has
identified, an awarding organisation must select for scrutiny examples of
marking by the Centre which go beyond those suggested by the Centre itself.  
Training and competence  
---  
All Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny must be carried out by persons who
have –  
(a) appropriate competence,  
(b) been provided with appropriate training, and  
(c) no personal interest in the outcome of the scrutiny.  
An awarding organisation must provide effective guidance to a Centre in
relation to its Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny including the minimum
expectations that the Centre must meet.  
Risk-based approach  
---  
An awarding organisation must take a risk-based approach to Centre Assessment
Standards Scrutiny and must put in place arrangements which go beyond our
minimum requirements where it considers it appropriate to do so both as part
of its obligation under Condition D3.1 to keep its approach under review and,
under Conditions A6 and A7, in response to any particular risk identified or
incident which has occurred.  
  
## Guidance on Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny other than Moderation

Condition H2.2(a) allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation
to Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny undertaken by an awarding
organisation.

We set out below our guidance for the purposes of Condition H2.2(a) in
relation to complying with, and going beyond our minimum requirements. Those
requirements, and the guidance below, do not apply to assessments that are
Moderated. Separate guidance has been provided in relation to Moderated
assessments.

An awarding organisation must have regard to this guidance in respect of each
assessment which is not subject to Moderation where evidence generated by a
Learner is marked by a Centre. This means that where, for example, a
qualification has two Centre-marked assessments, one of which is subject to
Moderation (either because it has been specified by Ofqual under Condition
H2.3(a) or the awarding organisation has chosen to Moderate it under Condition
H2.3(b)), the other assessment must be subject to Centre Assessment Standards
Scrutiny in line with this guidance.

### Complying with our minimum requirements

In line with our requirements published under Condition H2.2(a), an awarding
organisation must conduct periodic Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny,
including scrutinising markingNote 1 undertaken by a Centre.

In our requirements, we set out a list of activities that must be undertaken
annually in respect of each Centre. We expect that at least some of these
annual activities will take place in person, rather than remotely, and that
some will take place with short notice given to the Centre.

Forms of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny, other than Moderation, are not
required to take place before final results are issued.

We set out below examples of the factors an awarding organisation should
consider when determining its Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny
arrangements. We also provide examples of how an awarding organisation might
adapt its approach to conducting Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny in light
of these factors.

These factors are not intended to be exhaustive, and the weight an awarding
organisation attaches to them may vary, depending, for example, on the
qualification, assessment or Centre in question.

An awarding organisation should consider these factors and explain its
approach to a particular qualification, assessment or Centre in light of them
as part of its Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy.

Factors that we would expect an awarding organisation to consider when
determining its approach to conducting Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny
include the following –

  * The typical course of study for the qualification – for example, whether it is sessional or whether it is roll-on/roll-off and whether there are fixed start or end points for the qualification.
  * The typical duration of the course of study – for example, the number of terms a Learner typically takes to complete the qualification.
  * The typical Learner for the qualification and type of Centre delivering it – for example, whether these are school/college students, or employees taking qualifications through a training provider or employer.
  * The number of Components in the qualification and the number of these that are marked by a Centre.
  * The typical evidence generated by a Learner in assessments for the qualification – for example, a portfolio of evidence, a performance or a task/assignment.
  * The assessment model – for example, whether Components are graded or marked.
  * The number of Learners taking the qualification – the overall number and whether these are following the same course of study, or are part of different intakes per term.

An awarding organisation’s consideration of these factors may influence the
controls it puts in place as part of its Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny
arrangements, for example in relation to –

  * the typical frequency and type of monitoring activities it conducts in respect of the Centre,
  * the timing of such monitoring activities – for example, whether these happen during or after each term,
  * the number of Components sampled during monitoring activities – the number of Components and also which Components are sampled, for example whether these relate to Learners that have started the course of study at different times,
  * the time period over which all Components for a qualification are sampled – for example, whether every Component is sampled every year,
  * the number of Learners sampled during each activity for each Component,
  * whether sample checking involves Learners that have already received results for their qualification or only those that have yet to receive results,
  * whether all or some Learners are sampled prior to receiving results, and
  * the intended outcome of activities – for example, whether it would be likely to inform future changes to processes, require reassessment of Learners that have not yet received results, or lead to revocation of certificates that have already been issued

### Going beyond the minimum requirements

Our requirements also state that an awarding organisation must take a risk-
based approach to Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny and must put in place
arrangements which go beyond our minimum requirements where it considers it
necessary to meet any risks that it has identified in relation to a particular
Centre, assessment or qualification.

The tables below set out examples of when we will normally expect an awarding
organisation to go beyond our minimum requirements.

Factors in relation to the Centre  
---  
(a) Where a Centre has not previously marked assessments for the relevant
qualification.  
(b) Where there have been changes to the staff at a Centre responsible for
overseeing marking of the relevant assessment by that Centre.  
(c) Where there is a significant change in the profile of the Centre’s entries
for the relevant qualification, or the number of entries.  
(d) Where the awarding organisation establishes that, in respect of the
relevant assessment –  
(i) any malpractice or maladministration has occurred in relation to a
Centre’s delivery, marking or issue of results,  
(ii) the criteria against which Learners’ performance is differentiated are
not being applied consistently by a Centre in its marking, or  
(iii) a Centre has issued inaccurate results.  
Factors in relation to the qualification  
---  
(e) Where the qualification is substantially different in type or content from
any which the awarding organisation has made available before.  
(f) Where the professional standard for a qualification (for example, a
licence to practise) has changed.  
(g) Where an awarding organisation’s analysis of data and evidence suggests
that a particular approach is necessary.  
  
It is for an awarding organisation to consider what form any arrangements
which go beyond our minimum requirements should take and how long they should
remain in place, depending on the situation.

An awarding organisation may, for example, put in place different arrangements
for different Centres, or different assessments or Components within the same
qualification.

In all cases an awarding organisation must be satisfied that the Centre is
able to deliver, mark and issue results for the assessment in a manner which
allows the awarding organisation to comply with its Conditions of Recognition.

Where an awarding organisation considers it necessary to go beyond our minimum
requirements for reasons linked to a Centre’s performance, it should consider
whether it would be appropriate to make other awarding organisations on whose
behalf the Centre delivers qualifications aware of the relevant performance
issues.

### Notes

  1. For these purposes, ‘marking’ refers not only to assigning a numerical mark to the evidence generated by a Learner in an assessment, but to assigning any type of signifier which serves to differentiate one Learner’s performance from another in line with the criteria set under Condition G1.3. Examples can include the use of Pass/Fail, Pass/Merit/Distinction, or A/B/C/D etc. It should be noted that such signifiers may also serve as specified levels of attainment for the purposes of other conditions. ↩

## Guidance on Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny - Moderated assessments

Condition H2.2(a) allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation
to Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny undertaken by an awarding
organisation.

We set out below our guidance for the purposes of Condition H2.2(a) in
relation to Moderation. Separate guidance has been issued for forms of Centre
Assessment Standards Scrutiny other than Moderation.

Where Moderation is used for only some Centre-marked assessments within a
qualification, the remaining Centre-marked assessments must be subject to
Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny that meets our minimum requirements
published under Condition H2.2(a).

### Compliance with Conditions H2.4 and H2.5

Where Moderation is used for an assessment, that Moderation must meet the
requirements set out in Conditions H2.4 and H2.5 and in all cases an awarding
organisation must be satisfied that the Centre is able to deliver, mark and
issue results for the assessment in a manner which allows the awarding
organisation to comply with its Conditions of Recognition.

### Use of optional Moderation at different levels

Where an awarding organisation chooses to include Moderation in its
arrangements for Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny it may undertake that
Moderation at different levels. For example, it could choose to undertake
Moderation for –

  * assessments marked by an individual Centre,
  * individual assessments within a qualification,
  * assessments for particular Component, or
  * assessments undertaken by a particular cohort within a qualification.

### Sampling

Where Moderation of an assessment is required by Ofqual under Condition
H2.3(a)(i), all Centre-marked assessments in each year must be available for
sampling as part of that Moderation. For example, in a qualification with
three Centre-marked Components where Moderation is required, an awarding
organisation could not choose to sample assessments from Component A in year
1, Component B in year 2 etc. Assessments in all three Components need to be
sampled each year.

This is also the case where an awarding organisation chooses to apply
Moderation to an entire qualification under Condition H2.3(b), rather than to
certain Components or assessments within it. Where Moderation is applied to a
qualification as a whole, all Centre-marked assessments across all Components
must be liable to sampling in each year.

This is in contrast to the position for forms of Centre Assessment Standards
Scrutiny other than Moderation as our requirements for non-Moderation scrutiny
state that assessments from each Component do not need to be sampled each
year.

##  Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy requirements

Condition H2.6(a) requires an awarding organisation to establish and maintain
a Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy in respect of each
qualification for which assessments are marked by a Centre.

That strategy must cover all forms of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny
that the awarding organisation undertakes, including Moderation. This means
that, where an assessment is Moderated, that Moderation must still form part
of the strategy.

Condition H2.7 requires an awarding organisation to ensure that its Centre
Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy sets out how the awarding organisation
intends to secure, on an ongoing basis, compliance with Conditions H2.1 – 2.5
in respect of the assessments for that qualification.

Condition H2.6(b) requires an awarding organisation to comply with any
requirements in relation to Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategies
published by Ofqual. We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition
H2.6(b) below.

### Requirements

A Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy must provide a comprehensive
picture of the steps and approach an awarding organisation will take to secure
compliance with Conditions H2.1 – 2.5 in respect of the assessments for the
relevant qualification.

An awarding organisation may choose to have a Centre Assessment Standards
Scrutiny strategy that covers more than one of its qualifications. However,
where it does so, it must address any relevant differences that exist between
the qualifications covered. Such differences would include the types of
assessments for the relevant qualifications and the types of Centres marking
those assessments. For example, an awarding organisation may take a different
approach to a qualification in which assessments are intended to be delivered
on-demand to meet the needs of users to one which follows a more structured
delivery model.

A Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy must present a logical and
coherent narrative that includes clear and concise evidence in relation to the
matters set out in these requirements.

An awarding organisation’s Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy may
apply to one or more of its qualifications and may be contained in a single
document or a number of policies and procedures which, taken together, meet
the requirements below.

In particular, it must include reasoning and justification for its approach,
including when and how it would vary its approach to address risks and issues
that may arise.

We set out below the areas that a Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny
strategy must cover. We have published guidance alongside these requirements,
to help an awarding organisation understand what information it may choose to
provide in order to meet these requirements.

Section 1: Overall Approach  
---  
An awarding organisation must explain its overall approach to Centre
Assessment Standards Scrutiny and how its approach (including where it uses
Moderation) will ensure the standards and validity of its qualifications are
maintained where assessments are marked by Centres.  
It must explain why its approach is appropriate for its qualifications in view
of any risks that it has identified as arising from Centre marking and how it
will ensure that its qualifications are manageable for Centres delivering
them. It must explain how it will ensure, through its arrangements with a
Centre that it is able to comply with its Conditions of Recognition in respect
of assessments for that qualification.  
Section 2: Allowing Centres to mark assessments  
---  
An awarding organisation must explain its approach to deciding whether to
allow a particular Centre to mark assessments on its behalf. It must explain
how this approach will ensure that any Centre that marks assessments on its
behalf is capable of doing so in a way that will allow the awarding
organisation to comply with its Conditions of Recognition.  
Section 3: Monitoring  
---  
An awarding organisation must explain how it will ensure that its approach to
Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny will meet our minimum requirements. It
must explain the monitoring that it will undertake to ensure that its approach
is being delivered appropriately. It must explain how it ensures appropriate
competence of those involved in its processes, the information it will use to
carry out its monitoring, its approach to sampling, how it will provide
feedback to Centres and its approach to going beyond our minimum requirements
where appropriate.  
The awarding organisation must explain its approach to identifying, monitoring
and mitigating risks in relation to Centre assessment, including by going
beyond Ofqual’s minimum requirements where necessary. An awarding organisation
must explain how it ensures that its approach to risk in relation to Centre
Assessment Standards Scrutiny is based on appropriate evidence.  
Section 4: Taking action and making adjustments  
---  
An awarding organisation must explain its approach to taking action and making
adjustments to Centre marking where it considers this to be appropriate. It
must explain how it makes such decisions, and how it will ensure that such
decisions are taken consistently and in line with Ofqual’s Conditions,
requirements and guidance.  
Section 5: Ongoing review  
---  
An awarding organisation must explain how it will keep its approach under
review, to ensure its approach remains fit for purpose, and meets the
requirements of Condition H2 on an ongoing basis.  
  
## Guidance on Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategies

Condition H2.6(a) requires an awarding organisation to establish and maintain
a Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy in respect of each
qualification for which assessments are marked by a Centre.

That strategy must cover all forms of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny
that the awarding organisation undertakes, including Moderation. This means
that, where an assessment is Moderated, that Moderation must still form part
of the strategy.

Condition H2.6(c) requires an awarding organisation to have regard to any
guidance in relation to Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategies
published by Ofqual. We set out our guidance for the purposes of Condition
H2.6(c) below.

### General guidance on Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategies

As set out in our requirements, an awarding organisation’s Centre Assessment
Standards Scrutiny strategy can cover one or more of its qualifications and
may be contained in one or more documents.

Under Condition H2.1, an awarding organisation must have in place clear and
effective arrangements to undertake Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny.

Under Condition H2.2(a), we set out our minimum requirements in respect of an
awarding organisation’s approach to Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny for
assessments that are not Moderated. Such controls are the minimum that we
consider necessary in order to ensure the maintenance of standards and public
confidence in regulated qualifications. Our guidance under Condition H2.2(a)
sets out circumstances in which we expect an awarding organisation to consider
going beyond our minimum requirements.

The controls that an awarding organisation puts in place in relation to Centre
marking will vary based on the specific risks that it has identified in
relation to the qualification and the Centres delivering it, and what is
necessary to ensure valid qualifications that are manageable for Centres to
deliver. Based on these considerations, it may be appropriate for an awarding
organisation to go beyond our minimum requirements and impose higher levels of
control, such as more frequent activities, higher levels of sampling, and
closer monitoring.

An awarding organisation may choose, or be required, to put in place
Moderation as a form of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny, which will
require that all checks take place before results are issued.

We expect an awarding organisation to set out in its Centre Assessment
Standards Scrutiny strategy how the following factors have been considered in
developing its arrangements for Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny –

  * The qualification – An awarding organisation may take a different approach for a new qualification for which the standard is potentially less well-established or understood to that of an established qualification.
  * Nature of the assessments – An awarding organisation may be able to undertake forms of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny with higher levels of control for some assessments within a qualification rather than others. This could depend, for example, on the nature of the evidence generated by Learners.
  * The Centre – An awarding organisation may take a different approach to new Centres, or those it considers high-risk (for example, due to evidence of qualifications not being delivered in line with the awarding organisation’s requirements) to those it considers to be a lower risk.
  * Experience of an awarding organisation – A new awarding organisation, or an awarding organisation offering a qualification in a new sector may consider that closer Centre controls are necessary whilst it is establishing its systems and processes.
  * How the qualification is intended to be delivered – An awarding organisation may take a different approach to a qualification in which assessments are intended to be delivered on-demand to meet the needs of Users to one which follows a more structured delivery model.

### Detailed guidance on Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategies

We set out below detailed guidance on the specific information and evidence an
awarding organisation should include in its Centre Assessment Standards
Scrutiny strategy to meet our requirements. The amount of information and
evidence that should be included may vary across the areas identified,
depending on the approach adopted and the relevant aspects of the assessments
covered as well as the risks and pressures inherent in their form and use
(i.e. in licence to practise qualifications).

This guidance is not intended to provide a template specifying the form that a
Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy must take, since the optimal
structure and content of the strategy will depend on the approach that is
being taken by the awarding organisation. Although the form in which the
information is presented may vary from strategy to strategy, we expect all of
the areas in our requirements and the guidance below to be covered in each
strategy.

Section 1: Overall Approach  
---  
An awarding organisation should explain –  
• why it considers marking by a Centre appropriate for particular assessments
within a particular qualification or type of qualification,  
• the appropriateness of the approach based on the nature of the evidence
produced by Learners in the relevant assessment,  
• why its approach is appropriate to ensure valid and manageable
qualifications, based on the risks it has identified in relation to the
qualification and the Centres delivering it  
• how its approach will ensure that the results it issues in reliance on a
Centre’s marking are accurate and that standards for the relevant
qualification are maintained,  
• how it will ensure through its arrangements with a Centre that it is able to
comply with the Conditions.  
Section 2: Allowing Centres to mark assessments  
---  
An awarding organisation should explain –  
• how it takes a decision to approve a Centre to deliver and mark assessments
on its behalf and how it decides whether to approve a Centre to make
assessment judgements and issue results on its behalf,  
• the level of training and guidance it provides to Centres delivering and
marking its assessments.  
Section 3: Monitoring  
---  
An awarding organisation should explain –  
• the justification for its approach to Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny,
including how that approach meets our minimum requirements,  
• how it selects persons to undertake Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny,  
• the training it provides to persons carrying out Centre Assessment Standards
Scrutiny and any other means by which it ensures such persons are sufficiently
competent to carry out such tasks,  
• what information the awarding organisation will require the Centre to retain
in order to support its Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny,  
• how it will ensure that Centres retain any data (including evidence
generated by Learners and marked by Centres) that the awarding organisation
considers necessary to allow it to undertake Centre Assessment Standards
Scrutiny effectively,  
• the extent of its ongoing monitoring of a Centre once it starts delivering
and marking assessments, including the frequency of visits and what the
awarding organisation monitors, for example, Centre processes and procedures
and/or Centre capability, as well as marking,  
• how it will provide feedback to Centres and monitor Centres’ performance
over time,  
• the level of ongoing training and guidance it provides to Centres delivering
and marking its assessments.  
• the sampling approach it uses to ensure that samples are appropriate;  
• how it will consider selecting examples of marking by the Centre which go
beyond those selected by the Centre itself,  
• its approach to going beyond our minimum requirements and how it will have
regard to the factors set out in Ofqual’s guidance in this regard.  
**Risks**  
An awarding organisation should explain how its approach to Centre Assessment
Standards Scrutiny will allow it to –  
• identify and monitor all relevant conflicts of interest, and any scenario
that could foreseeably lead to such a conflict in the future,  
• take all reasonable steps to ensure that no such conflict has an Adverse
Effect,  
• take all reasonable steps to prevent the occurrence of any incident that
could have an Adverse Effect,  
• take all reasonable steps to prevent the occurrence of any malpractice or
maladministration in relation to the delivery or marking of assessments by a
Centre,  
• enter into arrangements with a Centre on terms which allow the awarding
organisation to comply with the Conditions as a whole, and monitor, and where
necessary take action, to ensure the Centre does not put the awarding
organisation’s compliance at risk,  
• ensure that assessments for the relevant qualification remain fit for
purpose upon delivery,  
• ensure that the criteria against which Learners’ performance is
differentiated are being accurately and consistently applied by Assessors,  
• ensure any results it issues are accurate and fully reflect the evidence
produced by the Learner and the Learner’s attainment when judged against the
standard set by the awarding organisation.  
  
An awarding organisation must explain how it has ensured that its approach to
risk in relation to Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny is based on
appropriate evidence.  
Section 4: Taking action and making adjustments  
---  
An awarding organisation should explain –  
• how it identifies and resolves issues such as malpractice relating to
Centres’ delivery and marking of an assessment,  
• how it will decide on the actions that it will take where it identifies an
assessment is not being delivered or marked in line with its requirements,  
• its approach to making adjustments to a Centre’s results  
Section 5: Ongoing review  
---  
An awarding organisation should explain how it keeps its processes under
review to ensure they remain fit for purpose and are improved as necessary.  
  
### Publication of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny Strategy

We do not require publication of an awarding organisation’s entire Centre
Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy. However, some elements of it may need
to be included in the specification for a qualification published under
Condition E3.

Regardless of whether any elements of the Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny
strategy are replicated in the specification, an awarding organisation is
required, under the minimum requirements published under Condition H2.2(a), to
provide effective guidance to Centres in relation to the minimum expectations
that they must meet.

Outside of our requirements, an awarding organisation may publish its Centre
Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategy, or parts of it, if it wishes to. Where
it does so, it must ensure that any such publication does not breach its
Conditions of Recognition.

## Guidance on making changes to incorrect results

Condition H6.1(d) requires an awarding organisation to issue results which
accurately and completely reflect the marking of assessments (including the
outcome of any Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny and other quality
assurance process).

Condition H6.3(a) requires an awarding organisation to correct any error in
the results it has issued where this is discovered through an appeals process.
In all other cases, where an awarding organisation discovers that any result
it has issued is incorrect it must, under Condition H6.3(b) consider whether
to correct it and have regard to any guidance published by Ofqual in that
respect.

We set out our guidance for the purposes of Condition H6.3(b) below.

### Introduction

We expect an awarding organisation to issue correct results to Learners. But
where an awarding organisation discovers that, despite its controls, it has
issued an incorrect result, it must have regard to this guidance when deciding
what to do.

An incorrect result is one that does not accurately reflect a Learner’s
performance in his/her assessment. It could be higher or lower than the level
of attainment which the Learner demonstrated. An awarding organisation may
discover that it has issued an incorrect result in different ways, including:

  * through the application of its own quality assurance processes;
  * through its investigations into malpractice or maladministration; or
  * where a review of marking or an appeals process reveals an issue which is relevant to other Learners’ assessments.

Where an awarding organisation discovers an error through an appeals process,
it must correct the result. In all other cases where an incorrect result is
discovered (and regardless of whether it is higher or lower than the level of
attainment demonstrated by the Learner), an awarding organisation must decide
what action to take, and whether or not to correct the result.

This guidance identifies a number of Conditions that place obligations on
awarding organisations which are relevant to this issue. It explains how an
awarding organisation should decide what action to take and some of the
factors it should consider. The importance of these factors will vary between
cases, but awarding organisations should adopt a consistent approach to
determine which are relevant and how to balance them.

In particular, this guidance focuses on an awarding organisation’s decision
whether or not to correct an incorrect result in circumstances other than
following an appeal. It is for the awarding organisation to take this decision
in each case, ensuring that it meets the requirements of the Conditions and
has regard to this guidance. Having taken this decision, the awarding
organisation should always consider whether it should take any other action to
comply with the requirements of the Conditions.

### What requirements must an awarding organisation meet?

Awarding organisations must comply with all of the Conditions which apply to
the qualifications they offer. The Conditions below are likely to be
particularly relevant to the issuing of results and to the action an awarding
organisation should take if it finds it has issued an incorrect result.

  * Condition A6.1 requires an awarding organisation to take all reasonable steps to identify the risk of any incidents which could have an Adverse Effect. Since the issuing of an incorrect result could (in many cases) have an Adverse Effect, an awarding organisation should actively consider any risks which might lead to this happening.
  * Condition A6.2 requires that where such a risk is identified, the awarding organisation takes all reasonable steps to prevent the incident from occurring or to reduce the risk of it occurring. The awarding organisation must also prevent, or if this is not possible mitigate, any Adverse Effect that the incident could have were it to occur.
  * Condition H5.1 requires an awarding organisation to ensure that the result of each assessment taken by a Learner reflects the level of attainment demonstrated by that Learner.
  * Condition H6.1(d) requires an awarding organisation to issue results which accurately and completely reflect the marking of assessments (including any Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny and other quality assurance process). Where an awarding organisation issues an incorrect result, it will have failed to comply with one or both of Conditions H5.1 and H6.1(d). There are a number of further requirements that could be relevant if an awarding organisation issues an incorrect result.
  * Condition A7.1 requires that where any incident occurs which could have an Adverse Effect, an awarding organisation must promptly take all reasonable steps to prevent the Adverse Effect or to mitigate it as far as possible and correct it. In doing so, it must prioritise the provision of assessments which accurately differentiate between Learners on the basis of the level of attainment they have demonstrated and the accurate and timely award of qualifications.
  * Condition A8.2 requires that where an awarding organisation suspects malpractice or maladministration and has reasonable grounds for doing so, it must promptly take all reasonable steps to prevent any Adverse Effect which may occur. Where an Adverse Effect does occur it must mitigate it and correct it as far as possible. This obligation may be relevant where an incorrect result has been issued as a result of malpractice or maladministration.
  * Condition I1.4 (or, where Condition I1 does not apply to a qualification, the relevant Qualification Level Condition) requires that if an awarding organisation discovers a failure in its assessment process through any Review Arrangements or appeals process, it must take all reasonable steps to identify any other affected Learners, correct or mitigate as far as possible the effect of the failure, and ensure that the failure does not recur. Awarding organisations must ensure that if specific Qualification Level Conditions are in place for Review Arrangements or appeals, such as those for reviews of Moderation, they are adhered to before considering the following guidance.

### What should an awarding organisation do when it discovers it has issued an
incorrect result?

Where an awarding organisation discovers that it has issued an incorrect
result, we expect it to:

  * understand what has happened. It should make sure it gathers adequate information on which to base any decision about what to do next and whether to correct the result;
  * determine whether the issue of the incorrect result has caused any Adverse Effect or whether there is the potential for any Adverse Effect to occur;
  * notify Ofqual, where any Adverse Effect has occurred or could occur (in accordance with Condition B3.1);
  * determine what action to take, including whether or not to correct the result and whether any other action should be taken;
  * keep a record of the decision it makes in respect of: whether any Adverse Effect has occurred or is likely to occur, whether or not to correct the result and on any other action it takes to prevent, mitigate or correct any Adverse Effect. It should be able to explain, on a case-by-case basis, what action it has taken and why.

### What should an awarding organisation consider when deciding what action to
take?

Where an awarding organisation discovers that it has issued an incorrect
result, it must take all reasonable steps to prevent any Adverse Effect which
could be caused or, where this is not possible, to mitigate and correct any
Adverse Effect. An Adverse Effect is most likely to be caused where the
issuing of the incorrect result:

  * prejudices the Learner who has been issued with the result or prejudices other Learners;
  * adversely affects the standard of the qualification; or
  * adversely affects public confidence in regulated qualifications.

In some instances, issuing an incorrect result could cause more than one
Adverse Effect and these could happen at different times.

Where the issuing of the incorrect result has had or could have an Adverse
Effect, the default position is that the awarding organisation should correct
the result. In most cases this will either prevent the Adverse Effect from
occurring or otherwise mitigate or correct it.

However, we recognise that correcting the result may have a negative impact
such that, balancing this impact against the Adverse Effect(s) involved, it
would not be a reasonable step for the awarding organisation to correct the
result.

Even where the awarding organisation does not consider the issuing of the
incorrect result has had or could have an Adverse Effect, it will have
breached a Condition. Correcting the result will help remedy that breach.
Again, we recognise that in some cases the negative impact of correcting the
result may be such that this would not be a reasonable course of action for
the awarding organisation to take.

We expect an awarding organisation to consider all relevant factors in order
to:

  * identify any Adverse Effects caused (or potentially caused) by issuing the incorrect result; and
  * decide what action it would be reasonable to take, balancing any Adverse Effect against any negative impact which may be caused by correcting the result.

The list below sets out factors which we expect an awarding organisation to
consider when deciding on a reasonable course of action (alongside any other
relevant factors).

  * Impact on the Learner who has been issued with an incorrect result - The awarding organisation should consider whether allowing an incorrect result to stand or correcting the result could prejudice the Learner. For example, prejudice may be caused if the result is corrected where the original result has already been used to make decisions, such as whether to re-take a qualification, enrol in further or higher education, or enter employment. Conversely, in some situations allowing a Learner to rely on a result which he/she has not actually achieved may prejudice that Learner.
  * Impact on other Learners \- The awarding organisation should consider whether allowing an incorrect result to stand could prejudice other Learners. For example, Learner A could miss out on a progression opportunity to Learner B because Learner B has incorrectly been given a higher result than his/her performance merited.
  * Public confidence - The awarding organisation should consider the impact on public confidence in regulated qualifications of it issuing an incorrect result and of the action it takes in response.
  * Standards - The awarding organisation should consider the impact on the standard of the qualification if it does not correct the error.
  * Number of Learners affected - The impacts on other Learners, on standards and on public confidence are likely to be greater if many Learners are affected.
  * Reliance on the incorrect result by third parties - Where third parties have relied on, or are likely to rely on, the incorrect result, the awarding organisation should consider whether that increases the possibility of an Adverse Effect. For example, if a qualification is a licence to practise, the awarding organisation should consider whether allowing a Learner who may not have demonstrated the level of competence indicated by the incorrect result to keep that result could have an Adverse Effect.
  * Timing - The length of time since the result was issued and any indication given by the awarding organisation that the result may or may not be final.
  * Malpractice - Whether the Learner’s own actions (including malpractice) contributed to the incorrect result being issued.

The extent to which each factor is relevant, and whether there are any others
that should be considered, will vary. This could depend, for example, on the
purpose of the qualification and how it is used by the Learner or other Users
of qualifications. Consideration of all the factors may not all point towards
one action.

An awarding organisation should determine which factors are relevant and give
appropriate weight to these in each case when deciding on its course of
action.

### Incorrect results discovered through Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny
other than Moderation

As Moderation takes place before results are issued, any errors discovered
through Moderation must be corrected prior to the issue of results in
compliance with Condition H2.5.

Where an awarding organisation uses a form of Centre Assessment Standards
Scrutiny other than Moderation, it may issue results and certificates on the
basis of a Centre’s assessment judgements without any prior check on the
standard of marking for each particular group Learners.

This means that where Moderation is not used incorrect results may not be
discovered until after those results have been issued by which point Learners,
and other Users of qualifications, may have placed reliance on the incorrect
results in the intervening period. As such, awarding organisations will need
to consider additional factors to those set out above. This section therefore
provides guidance which awarding organisations must consider in addition to
the guidance above where an error is discovered through Centre Assessment
Standards Scrutiny. In deciding whether or not to correct incorrect results
identified through Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny other than Moderation,
we expect an awarding organisation to consider the following factors, in
addition to the general guidance in relation to all qualifications set out in
the preceding sections:

  * The need to prioritise the maintenance of standards, which will normally lead to correction of errors.
  * The passage of time since results were issued.
  * Whether a qualification has been used to secure employment.
  * Any health and safety implications associated with the qualification.
  * Whether the qualification is a licence to practise.
  * The availability of opportunities to retake the assessment.
  * Any other Adverse Effect that might be caused by a decision to correct, or not to correct, a result.

In terms of the weight given to these factors, an awarding organisation should
prioritise the correction of results in situations where there are health and
safety implications associated with the qualification such that it may be
unsafe for a person to be undertaking a particular activity where he or she is
not competent to do so. An awarding organisation should also be alive to other
contexts that give rise to significant risks, such as qualifications relating
to children or the care of vulnerable people.

Where an awarding organisation corrects a Learner’s result in circumstances
that could lead to the Learner losing employment that has been gained in
reliance on the incorrect result, it should consider what further action might
be appropriate such as, for example, promptly providing an opportunity for the
Learner to take the relevant assessment again without charge.

### What should an awarding organisation do after deciding what action to
take?

In all cases, after deciding what action to take, an awarding organisation
should take all reasonable steps to communicate any change in result to any
affected Learners and, where appropriate, reissue results and/or certificates.

Condition I4.2(a) requires awarding organisations to take all reasonable steps
to issue a certificate and any replacement certificate. Where an awarding
organisation has decided to correct the result, it should ensure it does this.

An awarding organisation should consider any further actions it needs to take.
In accordance with Condition B3.5, the awarding organisation should notify
Ofqual of any steps that it has taken or intends to take to prevent an Adverse
Effect, or to correct or mitigate any Adverse Effect that occurs.

In accordance with Condition A6, an awarding organisation should consider
whether or not its contingency plan should be updated.

Condition D3.3 requires that where an event relating to an awarding
organisation has had an Adverse Effect, it must review and revise where
necessary its approach to the development, delivery and award of
qualifications to ensure it remains appropriate.

In particular, where the incorrect result relates to an assessment marked by a
Centre, an awarding organisation should review its arrangements for Centre
Assessment Standards Scrutiny in relation to the Centre in question or, where
wider risks are discovered, the relevant qualification in order to ensure that
those arrangements remain appropriate

## Certificate Requirements

This section sets out our Certificate Requirements for the purposes of General
Condition I3.1. An awarding organisation must ensure that the design of each
certificate in relation to a regulated qualification or credit award which it
makes available complies with these rules. These rules do not apply to unit
certificates or any other certificates which awarding organisations may issue.

An awarding organisation must ensure that the design and production of each
certificate it issues in relation to a regulated qualification or credit award
which it makes available includes the following requirements clearly and
distinctly expressed on the front of the certificate:

  1. the full name of the awarding organisation as recognised by Ofqual
  2. the full name of the Learner as registered
  3. for qualification certificates the Qualification Number or for credit certificates Unit Reference Number/s as assigned on the Register
  4. the level of attainment of the Learner
  5. the level of the qualification or credit
  6. the date (day/month/year) the awarding organisation confirms the Learner’s attainment by issue of a certificate
  7. Ofqual’s Logo in line with [Logo Requirements](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/section-b-the-awarding-organisation-and-ofqual#logo-requirements) which may be published by Ofqual and updated from time to time
  8. for credit certificates a statement that indicates that the learner has been awarded credit.

### Use of other logos

An awarding organisation may include other relevant logos, including those of
other regulators where appropriate.

You can find more information in our guidance (published jointly with CCEA
Regulation and Qualifications Wales) on [using regulators’ logos on
certificates](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/using-regulators-
logos-on-certificates).

## Condition J1.8 - Definitions

### Definitions

  1. J1.8 In these conditions, the following words shall have the meaning given to them below (and cognate expressions should be construed accordingly) –

#### the Act

The [Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act
2009](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/contents)

#### Adverse Effect

An act, omission, event, incident, or circumstance has an Adverse Effect if it
–

  1. (a) gives rise to prejudice to Learners or potential Learners, or
  2. (b) adversely affects – 
    1. (i) the ability of the awarding organisation to undertake the development, delivery or award of qualifications in a way that complies with its Conditions of Recognition,
    2. (ii) the standards of qualifications which the awarding organisation makes available or proposes to make available, or
    3. (iii) public confidence in qualifications.

#### Assessor

A person who undertakes marking or the review of marking. This involves using
a particular set of criteria to make judgements as to the level of attainment
a Learner has demonstrated in an assessment.

#### Associated Learner Fees

Any fee which is –

  1. (a) subject to negotiation, payable to an awarding organisation by a purchaser for an optional service that is directly related to the delivery and award of a regulated qualification to an individual Learner, and
  2. (b) not included in the Standard Qualification Fee.

#### Authentication

A process under which evidence generated by a Learner in an assessment is
confirmed as having been generated by that Learner (or identified and
confirmed as being that Learner’s contribution to group work) and as being
generated under the required conditions.

#### Centre

An organisation undertaking the delivery of an assessment (and potentially
other activities) to Learners on behalf of an awarding organisation. Centres
are typically educational institutions, training providers, or employers.

#### Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny

The process through which an awarding organisation –

  1. (a) periodically scrutinises the marking of assessments by a Centre to ensure that it has not deviated from required standards,
  2. (b) considers whether it is appropriate to correct any mark and, if appropriate, corrects that mark (including where changes are required under Condition H2.5(b)),
  3. (c) in line with Condition H6.3(b), considers whether it is appropriate to correct any incorrect result and, if appropriate, corrects that result, and
  4. (d) takes action to prevent such deviation from recurring.

#### Characteristic

Age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion
or belief, sex, and sexual orientation, as protected under Equalities Law.

#### Certificate Requirements

One or more documents of that title or with a title containing those words.

#### Change of Control

A change of control takes place in relation to an awarding organisation where
–

  1. (a) a person obtains control of the awarding organisation who did not, immediately prior to doing so, have control of it, or
  2. (b) the awarding organisation merges with any person.

Where the awarding organisation is a company, [sub-sections (2), (3) and (4)
of section 450 of the Corporation Tax Act
2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/4/section/450) shall apply for
the purpose of determining whether a person has or had control of the awarding
organisation.

#### Comparability

Generating assessment outcomes that are comparable in standards between
assessments within a qualification, between similar qualifications, with other
awarding organisations, and over time. Where an assessment has equivalent
forms then it is important to ensure comparability of outcomes. There are two
reasons for this –

  1. (a) To reach fair comparisons about the attainment of Learners: It is impossible to produce different forms with exactly the same content and statistical specifications (such as the level of difficulty or demand on the Learner). Therefore, a requirement to ensure comparability of outcomes makes sure the level of difficulty or demand of the test forms is taken into account when setting standards so that Learners taking the different forms can be compared fairly, and
  2. (b) To ensure that the outcomes can be used as a measure of standards: Outcomes from different forms of the same test must be comparable if they are to be used to measure standards over time. Both expert judgements and statistical procedures such as test equating can be used to ensure comparability of outcomes from different forms of the same test. It is, however, important to ensure that assessments are not so similar that they become predictable, as this would be a threat to Validity.

#### Competition Law

The Competition Act 1998, or any legislation in a jurisdiction other than
England which has an equivalent purpose and effect.

#### Component

A discrete part of a qualification which –

  1. (a) focuses on specific areas of the knowledge, skills and understanding assessed for the qualification, and
  2. (b) has a specific set of criteria against which Learners’ performance will be differentiated.

#### Conditions of Recognition

All conditions to which an awarding organisation’s recognition is subject
(including other conditions imposed under section 132(3)(d) of the Act).

### Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest exists in relation to an awarding organisation where –

  1. (a) its interests in any activity undertaken by it, on its behalf, or by a member of its Group have the potential to lead it to act contrary to its interests in the development, delivery and award of qualifications in a way that complies with its Conditions of Recognition,
  2. (b) a person who is connected to the development, delivery or award of qualifications by the awarding organisation has interests in any other activity which have the potential to lead that person to act contrary to his or her interests in that development, delivery or award in a way that complies with the awarding organisation’s Conditions of Recognition, or
  3. (c) an informed and reasonable observer would conclude that either of these situations was the case.

#### Data Protection Law

The following as they apply in England, and any legislation in a jurisdiction
other than England which has an equivalent purpose and effect –

  1. (a) [Regulation (EU) 2016/679](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj) on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
  2. (b) Any legislation in force from time to time in the United Kingdom relating to privacy and/or the processing of personal data, including but not limited to the [Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted) and the [Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426/contents/made).
  3. (c) Any statutory codes of practice issued by the Information Commissioner in relation to such legislation.

#### Endorsement

A reference in the title of a qualification acknowledging that the Learner is
focusing or has focused on one or more particular areas of knowledge, skills
and understanding which form part of the qualification (as encompassed in the
qualification title). (For instance, in GCSE Art and Design – Textile Design,
Textile Design is an Endorsement of GCSE Art and Design.)

#### Equalities Law

The [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents),
any Act that was a statutory predecessor to that Act, or any legislation in a
jurisdiction other than England which has an equivalent purpose and effect.

#### Governing Body

Where the awarding organisation is a limited company, the board of directors
of the awarding organisation. Where the awarding organisation is not a limited
company, a person or group of people having the equivalent status within the
organisational structure of the awarding organisation.

#### Group

Where an awarding organisation is a limited company, a group made up of any
company which is a holding company of the awarding organisation, a subsidiary
of the awarding organisation or a subsidiary of a holding company of the
awarding organisation. Where an awarding organisation is not a limited
company, a person or group of people having the equivalent status.

#### Guided Learning

The activity of a Learner in being taught or instructed by – or otherwise
participating in education or training under the Immediate Guidance or
Supervision of – a lecturer, supervisor, tutor or other appropriate provider
of education or training.

For these purposes the activity of ‘participating in education or training’
shall be treated as including the activity of being assessed if the assessment
takes place under the Immediate Guidance or Supervision of a lecturer,
supervisor, tutor or other appropriate provider of education or training.

#### Immediate Guidance or Supervision

The guidance or supervision provided to a Learner by a lecturer, supervisor,
tutor or other appropriate provider of education or training –

  1. (a) with the simultaneous physical presence of the Learner and that person, or
  2. (b) remotely by means of simultaneous electronic communication.

For these purposes, the activity of Invigilation is to be regarded as a form
of guidance or supervision.

#### Invigilation

The supervision by an appropriate person of Learners who are participating in
the activity of being assessed for a qualification, where such supervision
involves neither any teaching nor the giving of any guidance or direction
beyond that which is necessary to convey instructions for the carrying out of
the assessment or otherwise for the effective management of the assessment
activity.

#### Learner

A person who is registered to take a qualification and to be assessed as part
of that qualification.

#### Level of Demand

The degree of challenge that an assessment presents for the Learner.

#### Logo Requirements

One or more documents of that title or with a title containing those words.

#### Manageability

Manageability relates to the feasibility of carrying out particular assessment
processes. A Manageable assessment process is one which places reasonable
demands on Centres and Learners. The evaluation of the reasonableness of the
demands will be based on the scale of the assessment process on the
participants, balanced by the usefulness of the outcomes. As with the other
requirements (Validity, Reliability, Comparability and Minimising Bias),
judgements about Manageability must be balanced with considerations around the
other requirements.

#### Mandatory Centre Fees

Any mandatory fee which –

  1. (a) subject to negotiation, an awarding organisation requires a Centre to pay to it in order to undertake the delivery of an assessment to Learners (or any other activities) on behalf of the awarding organisation, irrespective of the number of Learners taking the qualification, and
  2. (b) is not included in the Standard Qualification Fee.

#### Minimising Bias

Minimising Bias is about ensuring that an assessment does not produce
unreasonably adverse outcomes for Learners who share a common attribute. The
Minimisation of Bias is related to fairness to all Learners and is also
closely related to statutory equality duties.

#### Moderation

A particular form of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny through which the
marking of assessments by Centres is monitored to make sure it meets required
standards and through which adjustments to a Centre’s marking are made, where
required, to ensure that results are based on the required standard.
Moderation takes place before final results are issued under Condition H6.1.

#### Ofqual’s Logo

Any logo, design or style in which Ofqual holds intellectual property rights.

#### Package Fee

Where an awarding organisation only makes a qualification available as part of
a package together with other products and services, any notional fee which is
-

  1. (a) subject to negotiation, payable to an awarding organisation by a purchaser of the package in respect of each of those other products and services, and
  2. (b) not included in the Standard Qualification Fee.

#### Portal

The information technology system provided by Ofqual to allow awarding
organisations to exchange information securely with Ofqual and CCEA
Regulation, as it may be varied and replaced from time to time.

#### Procure

To cause or bring about an outcome by care and effort.

#### Reasonable Adjustment

An adjustment made to an assessment for a qualification so as to enable a
disabled Learner to demonstrate his or her knowledge, skills and understanding
to the levels of attainment required by the specification for that
qualification.

#### Recognition of Prior Learning

The –

  1. (a) identification by an awarding organisation of any learning undertaken, and/or attainment, by a Learner – 
    1. (i) prior to that Learner taking a qualification which the awarding organisation makes available or proposes to make available, and
    2. (ii) which is relevant to the knowledge, skills and understanding which will be assessed as part of that qualification, and
  2. (b) recognition by an awarding organisation of that learning and/or attainment through amendment to the requirements which a Learner must have satisfied before the Learner will be assessed or that qualification will be awarded.

#### Register

The register published and maintained by Ofqual in accordance with section 148
of the Act.

#### Regulatory Document

A regulatory document, or part of a regulatory document, which features in a
document entitled the ‘[Regulatory Document
List](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulatory-document-list)’, which may be
published by Ofqual and may be varied and replaced by Ofqual from time to
time.

#### Reliability

Reliability is about consistency and so concerns the extent to which the
various stages in the assessment process generate outcomes which would be
replicated were the assessment repeated. Reliability is a necessary condition
of Validity, as it is not possible to demonstrate the Validity of an
assessment process which is not Reliable. The Reliability of an assessment is
affected by a range of factors such as the sampling of assessment tasks and
inconsistency in marking by human Assessors.

#### Responsible Officer

An individual appointed to act as an awarding organisation’s authoritative
point of contact for Ofqual.

#### Senior Officer

A director or senior executive officer of the awarding organisation or, where
the awarding organisation is not a limited company, a person holding a
position of equivalent status within the organisational structure of the
awarding organisation.

#### Special Consideration

Consideration to be given to a Learner who has temporarily experienced an
illness or injury, or some other event outside of his or her control, which
has, or is reasonably likely to have, materially affected the Learner’s
ability to –

  1. (a) take an assessment, or
  2. (b) demonstrate his or her level of attainment in an assessment

#### Standard Qualification Fee

A fee which, subject to negotiation, is payable to an awarding organisation by
a purchaser that represents the sum of all mandatory fees that must be paid in
respect of an individual Learner for that Learner to have the opportunity to
obtain one of the awarding organisation’s qualifications, including a
certificate in relation to it.

This would exclude any Learner pre-requisites clearly set out in the
qualification specification, for example prior learning or membership of a
professional body.

Where an awarding organisation only makes a qualification available as part of
a package, together with other products and services, the Standard
Qualification Fee will be the notional fee payable in respect of the
qualification only.

#### Stimulus Materials

Materials provided to the Learner before or at the time of the assessment
which facilitate the Learner’s demonstration of his or her knowledge, skills
and understanding. Tasks in an assessment may relate directly to the materials
and a Learner may make direct reference to the materials in completing the
assessment. Such materials may include, for example, charts, diagrams,
pictures, quotations or machinery.

#### Teacher

A person who prepares any Learner, or any person likely to become a Learner,
for assessment for a qualification and who does so –

  1. (a) as a lecturer, supervisor, tutor or other appropriate provider of education or training, or
  2. (b) in circumstances in which that preparation takes place primarily at home.

#### Total Qualification Time

The number of notional hours which represents an estimate of the total amount
of time that could reasonably be expected to be required, in order for a
Learner to achieve and demonstrate the achievement of the level of attainment
necessary for the award of a qualification.

Total Qualification Time is comprised of the following two elements –

  1. (a) the number of hours which an awarding organisation has assigned to a qualification for Guided Learning, and
  2. (b) an estimate of the number of hours a Learner will reasonably be likely to spend in preparation, study or any other form of participation in education or training, including assessment, which takes place as directed by – but not under the Immediate Guidance or Supervision of – a lecturer, supervisor, tutor or other appropriate provider of education or training.

#### Total Qualification Time Criteria (or ‘TQT Criteria’)

The TQT Criteria are criteria that are set and published by Ofqual for –

  1. (a) the purposes set out at section 146(1)(b) of the Act, and
  2. (b) the purpose of determining the number of hours of Total Qualification Time that should be assigned to a qualification by an awarding organisation.

The TQT Criteria may be set out in more than one document.

#### Users of qualifications

Persons who have a legitimate interest in the qualification or type of
qualification made available by the awarding organisation, which may include –

  1. (a) Learners and Learners’ representatives,
  2. (b) Centres,
  3. (c) Teachers,
  4. (d) employers and employers’ representatives,
  5. (e) further and higher education establishments,
  6. (f) schools,
  7. (g) government departments and agencies, and
  8. (h) professional bodies.

#### Validity

The extent to which evidence and theory support the interpretation that the
assessment outcomes meet their intended uses.

The evaluation of Validity involves the development of a clear argument to
support the proposed interpretation of the outcomes and as a consequence the
intended uses of the assessment. The Validity argument should be built on
statements of the proposed interpretation and supporting evidence collected
from all stages of the assessment process.

#### Workforce

Persons available for work (including employees, workers and contractors)

#  Using the Ofqual Handbook

How to use this handbook

## Content and application of the handbook

The handbook includes the following rules and guidance, which apply to all
awarding organisations and all qualifications we regulate:

  * our General Conditions of Recognition, which we set and publish using our powers under [section 134 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/section/134)
  * our guidance to the General Conditions of Recognition, which is designed to help awarding organisations understand how to comply with our rules. Awarding organisations must have regard to this guidance under [section 153 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/section/153)
  * all our other general rules and guidance for regulated qualifications, which were previously published in the following separate documents: 
    * ‘Additional Certificate Requirements’
    * ‘Logo Requirements’
    * ‘Qualification and Component Levels’
    * ‘Total Qualification Time Criteria’
    * ‘Criteria for determining whether a qualification is relevant for the purposes of the Education and Skills Act 2008’

### Which qualifications do we regulate?

The qualifications Ofqual regulates are set out in the [Apprenticeships,
Skills, Children and Learning Act
2009](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/contents).

The way the law works means that, even when we regulate an organisation, we do
not necessarily regulate all the qualifications it offers. Awarding
organisations can choose to ask us to regulate only some of their
qualifications. They might, for example, only ask us to regulate
qualifications of a particular level or type, or in a particular subject area.
We use the term ‘scope of recognition’ to describe all the qualifications an
organisation has asked us to regulate.

We regulate qualifications which:

  1. are within an awarding organisation’s scope of recognition, and
  2. have, or may be reasonably expected to have, persons seeking to obtain the qualification who are, or may reasonably be expected to be, assessed wholly or mainly in England.

Examples of qualifications we do not regulate include qualifications which
are:

  * outside an awarding organisation’s scope of recognition (for example, because they are a different level or type, or in a different subject area)
  * taken only by students outside England

## Structure and features of the handbook

The handbook is divided into sections, which correspond to the different
sections of our General Conditions of Recognition. Within each section, you
will find the relevant General Conditions, as well as:

  * any associated supporting requirements, and
  * any guidance we have published to help awarding organisations comply with those rules.

### Searching within the handbook

The search box at the top of each page allows you to search within the whole
handbook. results here will show you which sections of the handbook a search
term appears in. You can also extend search results to the whole of GOV.uk.

To search within a handbook section, first click ‘Open all’ to expand all
subsections:

![Open all
subsections](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/59bf90e640f0b60d8157050f/open-
all.png)

Then, use the search function built into your browser.

### Navigation

The navigation menu below the search box allows you to return to the front
page of the handbook.

![Navigation

You can also use normal navigation controls within your browser

### Defined terms

Throughout the handbook, we use capital letters to identify defined terms,
which have the meaning given in General Condition J1. If you hover over a
defined term, the definition will appear in a tooltip.

## Printing and downloading the handbook

You can print and save offline copies of individual handbook sections. It is
not currently possible to print or save the entire handbook - this is a
limitation of the GOV.uk platform.

To print a handbook section, navigate to it, and print it directly from your
web browser. This will print the entire section. You don’t need to expand
subsections first; this is done automatically when you print a section.

You can also use the ‘Print to PDF’ function built into most operating systems
to save local copies of individual handbook sections as PDF files.
